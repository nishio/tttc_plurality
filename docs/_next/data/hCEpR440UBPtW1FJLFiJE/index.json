Founded in 2012 by civic hackers including Kao Chia-liang, g0v arose from discontent with the quality of government digital services and data transparency.[^g0vManifesto] Civic hackers began to scrape government websites (usually with the suffix gov.tw) and build alternative formats for data display and interaction for the same website, hosting them at g0v.tw. These \"forked\" versions of government websites often ended up being more popular, leading some government ministers, like Simon Chang to begin \"merging\" these designs back into government services."},"4":{"comment":"[^g0vManifesto]: [g0v Manifesto](https://g0v.tw/intl/en/manifesto/en/) defines it as \"a non-partisan, not-for-profit, grassroots movement\".

While hackathons are common in many parts of the world, some of the unique features of g0v practices include the diversity of participants (usually a majority non-technical and with nearly full gender parity), the orientation towards civic problems rather than commercial outcomes and the close collaboration with a range of civic organizations.  These features are perhaps best summarized by the slogan \"Ask not why nobody is doing this. You are the 'nobody'!\", which has led the group to be labeled the \"nobody movement\".  They are also reflected in a Venn diagram commonly used to explain the movement's intentions shown in Figure A.  As we will note below, a majority of the initiatives we highlight grew out of g0v and closely aligned projects."},"7":{"comment":"While g0v gained significant public attention and support even in its earliest years, it burst most prominently onto the public scene during the Sunflower Movement we described above.  Hundreds of contributors in the g0v community were present during the occupation of the Legislative Yuan (LY), aiding in broadcasting, documenting and communicating civic actions. Livestream-based communication sparked heated discussion among the public. Street vendors, lawyers, teachers, and designers rolled up their sleeves to participate in various online and offline actions. Digital tools brought together resources for crowdfunding, rallies, and international voices of support."},"8":{"comment":"On March 30, 2014, half a million people took to the streets in the largest demonstration in Taiwan since the 1980s. Their demands, thus formulated, for a review process prior to the passage of the Cross-Straits Services Trade Agreement was accepted by LY Speaker Wang Jin-pyng on April 6, about three weeks after the start of the occupation, leading to its dispersal soon thereafter. The contributions of g0v to both sides and the resolution of their tensions led the sitting government to see the merit in g0v's methods and in particular cabinet member Jaclyn Tsai recruited one of us as a youth \"reverse mentor\" and began to attend and support g0v meetings, putting an increasing range of government materials into the public domain through g0v platforms."},"9":{"comment":"Many Sunflower participants devoted themselves to the open government movement; the following local (2014) and general (2016) elections saw a dramatic swing in outcomes of roughly 10 percentage points towards the Green camp, as well as the establishment of a new political party by the Sunflower leaders, the New Power Party, including leading Taiwanese rock star Freddy Lim. Together, these events significantly added to the momentum behind g0v and led to one of our appointment as Minister without Portfolio responsible for open government, social innovation and youth participation."},"10":{"comment":"During this process of institutionalization of g0v, there was growing demand to apply the methods that had allowed for these dispute resolutions to a broader range of policy issues.  This led to the establishment of [vTaiwan](https://vtaiwan.tw/intro/), a platform and project developed by g0v for facilitating deliberation on public policy controversies.  The process involved many steps (proposal, opinion expression, reflection and legislation) each harnessing a range of open source software tools, but has become best known for its use of the at-the-time(2015)-novel machine learning based open-source \"wikisurvey\"/social media tool Polis, which we discuss further in our chapter on [Augmented Deliberation](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-4/eng/?mode=dark) below.  In short, Polis functions similarly to conventional microblogging services like Twitter/X, except that it employs dimension reduction techniques to cluster opinions as shown in Figure B. Instead of displaying content that maximizes engagement, Polis shows the clusters of opinion that exist and highlights statements that bridge them. This approach facilitates both consensus formation and a better understanding of the lines of division."},"11":{"comment":"**<figcaption>Figure 2-2-B.

It had about 200,000 users or about 1% of Taiwan's population at its peak and held detailed deliberations on 28 issues, 80% of which led to legislative action.  These focused mostly on questions around technology regulation, such as the regulation of ride sharing, responses to non-consensual intimate images, regulatory experimentation with financial technology and regulation of AI."},"13":{"comment":"As a decentralized, citizen-led community, vTaiwan is also a living organism that naturally evolves and adapts as citizen volunteers participate in various ways. The community’s engagement experienced a downturn following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which interrupted face-to-face meetings and led to decreased participation. The platform faced challenges due to the intensive volunteering effort required, the absence of mandates for governmental responses, and its somewhat narrow focus. In response to these challenges, vTaiwan’s community has sought to find a new role between the public and the government and extend its outreach beyond the realm of Taiwanese regulation in recent years. A significant effort to revitalize vTaiwan was its collaboration with OpenAI’s Democratic Input to AI project in 2023. Through partnerships with Chatham House and the organization of several physical and online deliberative events centered on the topic of AI ethics and localization, vTaiwan successfully integrated local perspectives into the global discourse on AI and technology governance. Looking ahead to 2024, vTaiwan plans to engage in deliberations concerning AI-related regulations in Taiwan and beyond. In addition to Polis, vTaiwan is constantly experimenting with new deliberation and voting tools, integrating LLMs for summarization. The vTaiwan community remains committed to democratic experimentation and finding consensus among the public for policymaking. The earlier experience of vTaiwan outside of government also inspired the design of the official Join platform, which is actively used by citizens as a means of proposing issues and ideas to the government."},"14":{"comment":"The Public Digital Innovation Space (PDIS) that one of us established in 2016 to work with vTaiwan and other projects we discuss below in the ministerial role therefore supported a second, related platform [Join](https://join.gov.tw/). While Join also sometimes used Polis, it has a lighter-weight user interface and focuses primarily on soliciting input, suggestions and initiatives from a broader public, and has an enforcement mechanism where government officials must respond if a proposal receives sufficient support. Unlike vTaiwan, furthermore, Join addresses a range of policy issues, including controversial non-technological issues such as high school's start time, and has strong continuing usage today of roughly half of the population over its lifetime and an average of 11,000 unique daily visitors."},"15":{"comment":"While such levels of digital civic engagement may seem surprising to many Westerners, they can be seen simply as the harnessing of a small portion of the energy typically wasted on conflict on (anti-)social media towards solving public problems.  Even more concentrated applications of this principle have come by placing the weight of government behind  the g0v practice of hackathons through the Presidential Hackathon (PH) and a variety of supporting institutions."},"16":{"comment":"The PH convened mixed teams of civil servants, academics, activists and technologists to propose tools, social practices and collective data custody arrangements that allowed them to \"collectively bargain\" with their data for cooperation with government and private actors supported by the government-supported program of \"data coalitions\" to address civic problems.  Examples have included the monitoring of air quality and early warning systems for wildfires.   Participants and broader citizens were asked to help select the winners using a voting system called Quadratic Voting that allows people to express the extent of their support across a range of projects and that we discuss in our [⿻ Voting](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-6/eng/?mode=dark) chapter below.  This allowed a wide range of participants to be at least partial winners, by making it likely everyone would have supported some winner and that if someone felt very strongly in favor of one project they could give it a significant boost.  Winning project received a trophy -- a microprojector showing the President of Taiwan giving the award to the winners, leverage they could use to induce relevant government agencies or localities to cooperate in their mission, given the legitimacy g0v has gained as noted above."},"17":{"comment":"More recently, this practice has been extended beyond developing technical solutions to envisioning of alternative futures and production of media content to support this through \"ideathons\".  It has also gone beyond symbolic support to awarding real funding to valued projects (such as around agricultural and food safety inspections) using an extension of Quadratic Voting to Funding as we discuss in our [Social Markets](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-7/eng/?mode=dark) chapter."},"18":{"comment":"These diverse approaches to empowering government to more agilely leverage civil participation most dramatically came to a head during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Taiwan is widely believed (based on statistics we will discuss in the next section of this chapter) to have had one of the world's most effective responses to the crisis stage of the pandemic. Notably, it achieved among the lowest global death rates from the disease during that stage without using lockdowns and while maintaining among the fastest rates of economic growth in the world.  While being an island, having as Taiwan did an epidemiologist ready for an instant response as Vice-President and restricting travel clearly played a key role, a range of technological interventions played an important role as well."},"19":{"comment":"The best documented example and the one most consistent with the previous examples was the \"Mask App\". Given previous experience with SARS, masks in Taiwan were beginning to run into shortages by late January, when little of the world had even heard of Covid-19.  Frustrated, civic hackers led by Howard Wu developed an app that harnessed data that the government, following open and transparent data practices harnessed and reinforced by the g0v movement, to map mask availability.  This allowed Taiwan to achieve widespread mask adoption by mid-February, even as mask supplies remained extremely tight given the lack of a global production response at this early stage."},"20":{"comment":"Another critical aspect of the Taiwanese response was the rigorous use of testing, tracing and supported isolation to avoid community spread of the disease. While most tracing occurred by more traditional means, Taiwan was among the only place that was able to reach the prevalence of adoption of phone-based social distancing and tracing systems necessary to make these an important and effective part of their response. This was, in turn, largely because of the close cooperation facilitated by PDIS between government health officials and members of the g0v community deeply concerned about privacy, especially given the lack in Taiwan of an independent privacy protection regime, a point we return to below. This led to the design of systems with strong anonymization and decentralization features that received broad acceptance."},"21":{"comment":"Yet perhaps the single most important digital contributor to Taiwan's pandemic response was its ability to rapidly and effectively respond to misinformation and deliberate attempts to spread disinformation.  This \"superpower\" has extended, however, well beyond the pandemic and been critical to the successful elections Taiwan has held during a time when a lack of information integrity has challenged many other jurisdictions."},"22":{"comment":"Central to those efforts, in turn, has been the g0v spin-off project \"Cofacts,\" in which participating citizens rapidly respond to both trending social media content and to messages from private channels forwarded to a public comment box for requested response.  [Recent research](https://tech.cornell.edu/news/crowdsourced-fact-checking-fights-misinformation-in-taiwan/) shows that these systems can typically respond faster, equally accurately and more engagingly to rumors than can professional fact checkers, who are much more bandwidth constrained.[^CornellTech]"},"24":{"comment":"The technical sophistication of Taiwan's civil sector and its support from the public sector have aided in other ways as well.  This has allowed organizations like MyGoPen and private sector companies like Gogolook to develop and, with public support, rapidly spread chatbots for private messaging services like Line that make it fast and easy for citizens to anonymously receive rapid responses to possibly misleading information.  Government leaders' close cooperation with such civil groups has allowed them to model and thus encourage policies of \"humor over rumor\" and \"fast, fun and fair\" responses.  For example, when a rumor began to spread during the pandemic that there would be a shortage of toilet paper created by the mass production of masks, Taiwan's Premier Su Tseng-chang famously circulated a picture of himself wagging his rear to indicate it had nothing to fear."},"25":{"comment":"Together these policies have helped Taiwan fight off the \"infodemic\" without takedowns, just as it fought of the pandemic without lockdowns. This culminated in the January 13, 2024 election we mentioned above, in which a PRC campaign of unprecedented size and AI-fueled sophistication failed to polarize or noticeably sway the election."},"26":{"comment":"While these are some of the most prominent examples of Taiwanese digital democratic innovation, there are many other examples we lack the space to discuss in detail but will briefly list here."},"27":{"comment":"1. [Alignment assemblies](https://moda.gov.tw/en/major-policies/alignment-assemblies/1453#:~:text=In%20May%202023%2C%20the%20Ministry,the%20people's%20interests%20and%20create): Taiwan has pioneered convening, increasingly common around the world, of citizen participation in the regulation and steering of AI foundation models."},"28":{"comment":"2.

Land and spectrum: Building on the ideas of Henry George, Taiwan has among the most innovative policies in the world to ensure full utilization of natural resources, land and electromagnetic spectrum through taxes that include rights of compulsory sale (as we discuss further in our [Property and Contract](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-4/eng/?mode=dark) and [Social Markets](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-7/eng/?mode=dark) chapters)."},"32":{"comment":"7.

Digital diplomacy: Based on these experiences, Taiwan has become a leading advisor and mentor to democracies around the world confronting similar challenges and with similar ambitions to harness digital tools to improve participation and resilience."},"34":{"comment":"Furthermore, this work sufficiently won the confidence of both the public and the government that in August 2022 Taiwan created a Ministry of Digital Affairs, elevating one of us from Minister without Portfolio to lead this new ministry."},"35":{"comment":"While this is an interesting set of programs, one might naturally inquire about evidence of their efficacy.  Tracing causal impacts precisely for so many projects is obviously an arduous task beyond our scope here.  But at very least it is reasonable to ask how Taiwan has performed overall on the range of challenges that has so troubled most liberal democracies in the last decades.  We consider each categories of these in turn. Unfortunately, the quality of analysis and comparison possible is not all it could be given the complex geopolitics around Taiwan's international status meaning that many standard international comparators choose not to include it in their data."},"36":{"comment":"While the economic lens of Taiwan's performance is far from the most important, it is one of the easier to quantify and provides a useful baseline for understanding the starting point for the rest.  In one sense, Taiwan is an upper-middle income country, like much of Europe, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of $34,000 per person in 2024 according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).[^IMFgdp]  However, prices are much lower in Taiwan on average than in almost any other rich country; making this adjustment (which economists call \"purchasing power parity\") makes Taiwan the second richest country on average other than the US with more than 10 million people in the world.  Furthermore, as we discuss below, most sources suggest that Taiwan is much more equal than the US, which means it is likely the country of that size with the highest typical living standards in the world.  Thus Taiwan is best thought of as among the absolute most developed economies in the world, rather than as a middle-income country."},"37":{"comment":"The sectoral focus of Taiwan's economy stands out as well.  While perfectly comparable data are hard to come by, Taiwan is almost certainly the most digital export-intensive economy in the world, with exports of electronics and information and communication products accounting for roughly 31% of the economy, compared to less than half that fraction in other leading technology exporters such as Israel and South Korea.[^TradingEcon]  This fact is best known to the world for what it reflects: that most of the world's semiconductors, especially the most advanced ones, are manufactured in Taiwan and Taiwan is also a major both manufacturer and domicile for manufacturers of smartphones such as Foxconn."},"38":{"comment":"Taiwan is also unusual among rich countries in its relatively low tax take; according to the Asia Development Bank, Taiwan collected only 11% of GDP in taxes compared to 34% on average in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) club of rich countries.[^taxtake] Relatedly, Taiwan ranked 4th in the world in the Heritage Foundation's Economic Freedom Index.[^EconFreedom]"},"39":{"comment":"Given this background, several features of Taiwan's economic performance in the last decade stand out."},"40":{"comment":"1. Growth: Taiwan has averaged real GDP growth of 3% over the last decade, compared to less than 2% for the OECD, a bit over 2% for the US and 2.7% for the world overall.[^WB]2. Unemployment: Taiwan has averaged an unemployment rate of just under 4% steadily in the last decade, compared to an OECD average of 6%, a US average of 5% and a world average of around 6%."},"41":{"comment":"3. Inflation: While inflation has spiked and wildly fluctuated around the world including almost all rich countries, Taiwan's inflation rate has remained relatively steady the last decade in the 0-2% range, averaging 1.3% according to the IMF."},"42":{"comment":"4. Inequality: The last decade has seen significant debate about methods in calculating inequality statistics.  Using more traditional methods, Taiwan's Survey of Family Income and Expenditure has found that Taiwan's Gini Index of inequality (ranging from 0 for perfectly equal to 1 for perfectly unequal) has been steady at around .28 for the last decade, placing it around the level of Austria on the lower end of global inequality and far lower than the roughly .4 of the US.  Other analyses, using innovative but controversial administrative approaches pioneered by economists including Emmanuel Saez, Thomas Piketty, and Gabriel Zucman show Taiwan's top 1% income share at 19%, not far behind the US at 21% and well above a country like France at 13%.  However, even in these data, Taiwan's top 1% share has fallen by about a tenth in the last decade, while in both France and the US it has risen by a similar proportion.  Furthermore, a number of studies have recently argued these methods tend to find higher inequality in countries and time periods with lower and less progressive taxes as they rely on tax administration data and struggle to fully account for induced avoidance.[^Inequalitycritique] Given Taiwan's dramatically lower tax take than either the US or France, it seems likely that if these issues apply anywhere, they would lead to a substantial overstatement of Taiwanese inequality.[^CapitalShare]"},"43":{"comment":"Putting these facts together, what is notable is that Taiwan's economic performance has been strong and fairly egalitarian or at least not becoming more unequal *despite its wealth and extreme tech-intensity*. As we documented above, economists have widely blamed the role of technology for many recent economic woes, including slow growth, unemployment and rising inequality.  In the world's most tech-intensive economy, this seems not to be the case."},"44":{"comment":"Internationally comparable social indicators are far more difficult than even economic ones for Taiwan, given that it is excluded from the World Health Organization (WHO).  However, we were able to find roughly comparable data on two commonly cited social indicators: loneliness and self-reported technology addiction. Loneliness among older adults (above 65) in Taiwan stands at roughly 10%, which puts it around similar rates in the least affected countries in the world (mostly in Northern Europe), better than in North America (roughly 20%) and much better than in the PRC (more than 30%).[^Loneliness]  Another comparison is self reported cellphone addiction rates, which are fairly high in Taiwan (at roughly 28%) but much lower than in the US (at 58%).[^Addiction]  Differences in rates of addiction to controlled substances are even more dramatically different, with about 10 times as many Americans reporting using illegal drugs at least monthly than Taiwanese *who have ever tried an illegal drug*.[^drugs]"},"45":{"comment":"Taiwan is also marked by a unique experience with religion among rich countries, almost all of which (especially the United States) are both dominated by a single broad religious group (e.g. Christianity) and have seen dramatic declines in a range of measures of religiosity including affiliation and participation in the past decades.[^GivingUp]  Religion in Taiwan, by contrast, is far more diverse with a roughly equal mix of followers of four distinct religious traditions: folk religion, Taoism, Buddhism, Western and minority religions, with about an equal proportion as each of these being non-believers.[^religionTaiwan]  At the same time, while there has been some shift among these groups, there has hardly been any significant increase in non-belief or non-practicing in Taiwan in the past decades.[^wikireligion]"},"46":{"comment":"Taiwan is widely recognized both for the quality of its democracy and its resilience against technology-driven information manipulation.  Several indices, published by organizations such as Freedom House[^Freedom], the Economist Intelligence Unit[^EIU], the Bertelsmann Foundation and V-Dem, consistently rank Taiwan as among the freest and most effective democracies on earth.[^demrank]  While Taiwan's precise ranking differs across these indices (ranging from first to merely in the top 15%), it nearly always stands out as the strongest democracy in Asia and the strongest democracy younger than 30 years old; even if one includes the wave of post-Soviet democracies immediately before this, almost all are less than half Taiwan's size, typically an order of magnitude smaller.  Thus Taiwan is at least regarded as Asia's strongest democracy and the strongest young democracy of reasonable size and by many as the world's absolute strongest.  Furthermore, while democracy has generally declined in every region of the world in the last decade according to these indices, Taiwan's democratic scores have substantially increased."},"47":{"comment":"In addition to this overall strength, Taiwan is noted for its resistance to polarization and threats to information integrity. A variety of studies using a range of methodologies have found that Taiwan is one of the least politically, socially and religiously polarized developed countries in the world, though some have found a slight upward trend in political polarization since the Sunflower movement.[^polarization]  This is especially true in *affective polarization*, the holding of negative or hostile personal attitudes towards political opponents, with Taiwan consistently among the 5 least affectively polarized countries."},"48":{"comment":"This is despite analyses consistently finding Taiwan to be the jurisdiction targeted for the largest volume of disinformation on earth.[^disinfovolume]  One reason for this paradoxical result may be the finding by political scientists  Bauer and Wilson  that unlike in many other contexts, foreign manipulation fails to exacerbate partisan divides in Taiwan. Instead, it tends to galvanize a unified stance among Taiwanese against external interference.[^Disinfo]"},"49":{"comment":"Taiwan is consistently ranked as one of the five safest countries in the world and the safest democracy in the world with more than 100,000 people by a very large margin.[^crime]  When one of us first traveled to Taiwan, he was shocked to receive compensation for his flight as a large envelope of cash, which most Taiwanese feel comfortable carrying given the extreme safety.  Furthermore, crime in Taiwan continues to trend steadily downward even as countries like the US have seen dramatic surges in especially violent crime.[^crimevus]  It is worth noting, however, that it has achieved this historically with a fairly strong police presence (somewhat higher than the US) and an incarceration rate that while far short of the US is high by global standards."},"50":{"comment":"Taiwan's legal-political system has also distinguished itself for its ability to adapt to inclusively resolve long-standing social conflicts.  In 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled that the government must pass a law to legalize same-sex marriage within two years.  After the failure of a referendum on a straightforward same-sex marriage proposal in 2018, the government found a creative way to respond to the interests of all sides.  Many who opposed same-sex marriage were concerned that because of traditions of extended families being bound together by marriage, family members opposing the practice could be forced to participate.  At the same time, most young people who planned to take advantage of the new provision had more individualistic, partner-based visions of marriage and had no desire to bind their families either, leading the government to pass a legalization bill that exempted kin from the same-sex marriage process."},"51":{"comment":"Crises come rarely and with low probability.  It is thus hard to know how well Taiwan might perform in avoiding or mitigating one.  However, perhaps the closest one can reach for is an emergency that did occur: the Covid-19 pandemic.  As noted above, Taiwan was widely seen as among the best if not the very best performing country in the world during this episode and here we discuss the quantitative reasons for this esteem."},"52":{"comment":"The exceptional performance that won Taiwan this international acclaim occurred during the focal early stages of the pandemic, during which much of the world was in rolling lockdowns prior to the availability of the vaccine.  We can call this the \"crisis\" stage of the pandemic and declare it to have ended in April 2021, when vaccines were widely available in the US.  From the start of the pandemic to April 2021, Taiwan suffered only 12 deaths to the pandemic, giving it by far the lowest death rate to that point of any jurisdiction with estimates considered internationally accurate.  Furthermore, Taiwan achieved this without any lockdowns and achieved the fastest economic growth of any rich country bar Ireland in 2020.   More broadly, Taiwan's health system has for the better part of a decade been ranked as the world's most efficiently performing by Numbeo, though life expectancy in Taiwan is merely among the highest in the world.[^Numbeohealth]"},"53":{"comment":"It is important to note, however, that Taiwan performed much less impressively during the \"post-crisis\" phase following mid-2021, during which vaccine availability and uptake were the most critical components of response and challenges with domestic vaccine production and distribution led to significant loss of life in the coming years.  Taiwan still had among the lowest death rates and best economic performance reliably measured by a rich jurisdiction of significant size, but its exceptional leadership early in the pandemic did not fully persist after the crisis phase. This may indicate that the cohesion and civic engagement fostered by crises (like Sunflower and the Pandemic) allow Taiwan to respond more effectively than anywhere in the world, but that additional care and focus is needed to ensure these efforts are institutionalized and sustainable, an important direction for the future we discuss further below."},"54":{"comment":"Another slow-burning crisis that may illustrate this challenge is climate change.  While Taiwan has joined many other countries in enshrining its 2050 net zero ambitions into law and has won praise for its plans to reach this goal, its progress thus far has been modest.[^climate]  More broadly, Taiwan has a strong but not outstanding record on environmental protection.[^epi]"},"55":{"comment":"[^climate]: “Net Zero Tracker,” Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, 2023. https://eciu.net/netzerotracker.[^epi]: “2022 EPI Results,” Environmental Performance Index, 2022, https://epi.yale.edu/epi-results/2022/component/epi."},"56":{"comment":"Taiwan nonetheless exhibits unusually high levels of participation and trust in institutions, particularly in its democracy.  Voter turnout is among the highest in the world outside countries where voting is compulsory.[^turnout]  91% consider democracy to be at least \"fairly good\", a sharp contrast to the dramatic declines in recent years in support for democracy even in many long-established democracies.[^demsupp]"},"58":{"comment":"[^demsupp]: “Taiwan Country Report Report,” BTI Transformation Index, n.d., https://bti-project.org/en/reports/country-report/TWN."},"59":{"comment":"In short, while like all countries it has key limitations, Taiwan deserves a leading place among global exemplars that it is too rarely afforded. Admiration for Scandinavian countries is a constant refrain on the left in the West, as is praise for Singapore on the right.  While all these jurisdictions have important lessons and in fact many important points of overlap with Taiwan, few places offer the breadth of promise in addressing today's leading challenges that Taiwan does and appeal across the typical divides as it does. As an economically free, vibrantly participatory liberal democracy Taiwan both has something to offer all points on the political spectrum of the West and holds arguably the most compelling example available to those looking to leapfrog the practices of increasingly ailing Western democracies.  This is especially true given its starting point: without abundant natural resources or strategic position, in a fragile geopolitical setting, with a deeply divided rather than homogeneous and robust sized population and only democratizing a few decades ago, rising from abject poverty in less than a century."},"60":{"comment":"It will doubtless take decades of study to understand the precise causal connections between Taiwan's unique and dramatic digital democratic practices and the range of success it has found in confronting today's most vexing challenges.  Yet given this appeal, in the interim, it seems critical to articulate as so many have done for Scandinavia and Singapore, the generalizable philosophy behind the strategies of the world's most admired digital democracy.

These conclusions have been increasingly accepted in social sciences, like political science and economics, that traditionally viewed technology progress as fixed and given.  Two of the world’s leading economists, Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson, have recently published a book that argues that the direction of technological progress is a key target for social policy and reform while documenting the historical contingencies that led to the directions of technology we have seen in the past[^PowerProgress]."},"161":{"comment":"Perhaps the most striking illustration comes from comparing the ways technology has advanced across countries today.  Where once leading thinkers predicted the power of technology to sweep away social differences, today the technological systems of powers great and sometimes small define their competing social systems as much as their formally stated ideologies: the PRC surveillance regime looks like one technological future, while the Russian hacking networks seem another, the growing space of web3-driven communities a third, the mainstream Western capitalist countries on which we have focused a fourth and the heterogeneous digital democracies of India, Estonia, and Taiwan something else entirely that we will explore in depth below.  Also possible, largely along the web3 community-driven approach, is an African model that could be built on open source and interoperability, reflective of the communal inclination of many African cultures.

Yet the defining technology of the 1980s was quite opposite: the personal computer that made computing a complement to individual human creativity.  The 1990s were haunted by Stephenson’s science fictional imagination of the possibilities of escapist virtual worlds and atomizing cryptography, the connective tissue of the internet swept the world, ushering in an unprecedented age of communication and cooperation.  Mobile telephony in the 2000s, social networking in the 2010s, and the scaffolding of remote work in the 2020s…none of these have focused on either cryptographic hypercapitalism or artificial superintelligence.   This reflects, with an extensive lag, the shift in investments made by public sector research funders away from supporting these technologies and towards investment in cryptography and artificial intelligence, as we discuss and document in \"The Lost Dao\" below, driven by a variety of (geo)political factors."},"172":{"comment":"If the path of technology is not predetermined and instead can be significantly shaped by collective choices regarding investment, how should we think about the flexibility we have as a society in choosing among possible directions?

It is \"common sense\" that different societies have chosen or might choose to organize themselves in terms of different (combinations of) ideologies: communism, capitalism, democracy, fascism, theocracy, etc.  Each of these incorporates strengths and weaknesses, appeals to some more than to others, and coheres and prescribes to differing degrees.  There may be configurations of these ideologies that simply do not work or require specific historical and social conditions."},"174":{"comment":"We might look at different trajectories for technology in a similar way.  The range of futures is not unlimited or infinitely malleable: some things are easier, harder, or outright impossible. But neither is it predetermined. There are clusters of plausible visions of the future and technologies that empower these; through our collective technological investments, we help choose among these possibilities."},"175":{"comment":"While a bit less familiar than the linear and progressive story about technology that is most common today, this perspective is very far from original.  It is a recurring theme in literature, scholarship, and even entertainment.

A key element of the technocratic social vision is therefore material redistribution, usually through a “universal basic income” (UBI).  Another central focus is on the risk of AI(s) getting out of human control and threatening human survival, and thus on the need for strong and often centralized control over who has access to these technologies, as well as ensuring they are built to faithfully execute human desires. While the precise contours differ across the exponents of this view, the idea of “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI) is central: machines that exceed human capabilities in some generalized way, leaving little measurable utility in human individual or collective cognition."},"179":{"comment":"Leading exponents of this view in Silicon Valley are Altman and his mentor Reid Hoffman and until recently Altman’s OpenAI co-founder Elon Musk.  The view is also popular in the PRC, where it has been advanced by Jack Ma, economist Yu Yong-Ding and even by the PRC’s official New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan with a strong reliance on the Marxist idea of “central planning”.  It also appears throughout science fiction, particularly the work of authors mentioned above like Asimov, Banks, Kurzweil and Bostrom.  Bostrom's latest book, *[Deep Utopia: Life and Meaning in a Solved World](https://nickbostrom.com/deep-utopia/)*, is perhaps the purest expression of this view.[^Deep]   Leading organizations aligned with this perspective include OpenAI, DeepMind, and other advanced artificial intelligence projects.

In fact, several leading hard right politicians are closely connected to the Libertarian worldview: prominent British Conservative Member of Parliament Jacob Rees-Mogg is the son of Lord William Rees-Mogg, Thiel employs former Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and Thiel protégés Blake Masters and J.

A new generation of approaches has recently tried to improve more dramatically on what is possible."},"296":{"comment":"While the above problems seem diverse, they boil down to two questions: how to appropriately represent degrees and weights of interests and how to make representation flexible and adaptive.  As Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen famously observed, problems with Arrow's Theorem vanish once strength and weight of preference is accounted for, and evidently weighted voting is all about such issues.[^Sen]  Representation of subgroups is challenging as there are strong ⿻ reasons for doing it, yet many ways of achieving it seem insufficient or overly rigid and prescriptive.  These strike at the core of the problem with the extreme simplicity of votes: they carry very limited information about voters' thoughts and preferences."},"297":{"comment":"Two recent developments have offered exciting, though incomplete, approaches to addressing these problems.  We highlighted the first at the start of the chapter: quadratic voting and other related approaches to incorporating voting weights.  Quadratic voting originates with statistician (and, unfortunately, eugenicist) [Lionel Penrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Penrose), father of the prominent contemporary astrophysicist [Roger Penrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose).  He noted that, when weighing votes, it is natural, but misleading, to give a party with twice the legitimate stake in a decision twice the votes.  The reason is that this will typically give them more than twice as much power.  Uncoordinated voters on average cancel one another out and thus the total influence of 10,000 completely independent voters is much smaller than the influence of one person with 10,000 votes.[^Penrose]"},"298":{"comment":"[^Penrose]: L. S. Penrose, \"The Elementary Statistics of Majority Voting\", *Journal of the Royal Statistical Society* 109, no. 1 (1946): 53-57."},"299":{"comment":"A physical analogy, prominently studied simultaneously with Penrose by J.C.R. Licklider (our hero in [The Lost Dao](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/3-3/eng/?mode=dark) above), may be useful to see why.[^Lick]  Consider a noisy room where one is trying to have a conversation.  It is often the case that the overall decibels of the noise are far greater than the strength of the voice of a conversation partner.  Yet it is often still possible to hear what they are saying.  Part of this is driven by the human capacity for focus, but another factor is that precisely what makes the background \"noise\" is that each contributor is far weaker than the (closer) voice one is attending to.  Given that the sounds of all this noise are largely unrelated, they tend to cancel out on average and allow the one voice that is just a bit stronger to shine far stronger.  Visual signal processing can be similar, where a range of scribbles fade into a gray or brown background, allowing a clear message that is only slightly stronger to stand out against it."},"300":{"comment":"When background signals are completely uncorrelated and there are many of them, there is a simple way to mathematically account for this: a series of uncorrelated signals grows as the square root of their number, while a correlated signal grows in linear proportion to its strength.  Thus 10,000 uncorrelated votes will weigh as heavily as only 100 correlated ones.  This implies that, to award the holder of stake only proportionately greater power, its voting weight should grow as the square root of its stake, a principle often called \"[degressive proportionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degressive_proportionality)\".  This in turn suggests a direction for addressing several challenges above by making a geometric (multiplicative) compromise between the intuitions of weighted and simple voting and by allowing expression of preference strength across issues and votes but taking the square root of the \"weight\" a voter puts on any issues.  The former idea is Penrose's \"[square-root voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_method)\" rule, approximately used in several elements of governance in the European Union across member nations. The later is the QV rule we discussed above and used, for another example, frequently in the [Colorado State Legislature](https://www.radicalxchange.org/wiki/colorado-qv/) to prioritize spending."},"301":{"comment":"It is important to note, however, that these clean rules are only optimal when voters are perfectly internally unified and perfectly externally uncorrelated/uncoordinated.  ⿻ thinking cautions us against such simplistic models, encouraging us to perceive the social connections across individuals and organizations, though of course accounting for these within a voting system requires identity systems that can record and account for these."},"302":{"comment":"Another compatible approach that has gained ground in recent years is \"liquid democracy\"(LD).  This idea, which traces back to the path-breaking work of Charles Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll, author of the children's classic *Alice in Wonderland*), who also first posed the question of weighting of votes for people holding multiple votes that helped inspire QV.[^Carroll]  LD extends the idea of proportional representation, allowing any voter to delegate their vote(s) to others, who may then re-delegate them, allowing bottom-up, emergent patterns of representation.[^PICSY]  Such systems are increasingly common, especially in corporate and other for-profit (e.g. DAO) governance, as well as in a limited set of political contexts such as Iceland.  However, these systems have an unfortunate tendency to concentrate power often excessively, given that delegation often flows to a small number of hands.  This tendency has somewhat soured initial enthusiasm."},"303":{"comment":"[^Carroll]: Charles L.

The range of possibilities are nearly endless, but a few promising ones are useful to illustrate this breadth:"},"306":{"comment":"- Correlation discounting and eigenvoting: QV and the Penrose rule apply degressive proportionality (using the the square-root rule)  to the voting weights of respectively individuals and/or social groups (like nations).  A natural extension would be to allow for a wider diversity of sources of correlation/coordination within and across individuals, as would be true in a general statistical model.  In this case, an optimal rule would likely involve partial \"correlation discounting\" based on the degree of social connection and, perhaps, the identification of underlying \"principal\" social factors that drive coordination and correlation, as is common in statistical modeling.[^Pluralvote] These underlying independent factors, called \"eigenvalues\", could then be viewed as the \"real\" independent voters, to whom degressive proportionality could be applied, a process not dissimilar to how PageRank works.  This could create a dynamic, adaptive, optimized version of consociationalism that avoids its rigidity and entrenchment of existing divides."},"307":{"comment":"- Adaptive representation:  Another approach to similarly adaptive representation would be a single-member district or federal system, but with boundaries not based (exclusively) on geography but instead current social divides, such as geographic type (urban v. rural), race, or education.  Clearly both this and the previous idea rely heavily on a ⿻ [identity](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-1/eng/?mode=dark) system to allow these features to be inputs into the voting process."},"308":{"comment":"- Predictive voting: [Robin Hanson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson) has long advocated combining prediction markets (where people bet on future outcomes) with voting.  While the \"[Futarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futarchy)\" proposal he has advanced focuses on a cleaner separation between these two elements, in the governance of this book described above we use such a mixture, with participants being able to simultaneously vote and predict the outcome of a decision, being rewarded for a correct decision.[^Futarchy]  Such systems may be particularly useful when there is a large range of proposals or options: predictions can help bring attention to proposals deserving attention that voting can then decide on."},"309":{"comment":"- Quadratic liquid democracy: As noted above, a natural way to avoid the power concentrations that liquid democracy can give rise to is the use of degressive proportionality.  [RadicalxChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org), a non-profit advancing ⿻, has implemented a related system for its internal decision-making."},"310":{"comment":"- Assisted real-time voting: Another commonly discussed idea is that voting could be made far more frequent and granular if digital assistants could learn to model voters' perspectives and preferences and vote on their behalf and subject to their review/auditing.[^Gilman]"},"311":{"comment":"[^Futarchy]: Robin Hanson, \"Shall we Vote on Values but Bet on Beliefs?\", *Journal of Political Philosophy* 20, no. 2: 151-178."},"312":{"comment":"Perhaps the most exciting possibilities are now these could combine infinite diversity, infinitely combining to support the infinite combinations that they help infinite diversity form."},"314":{"comment":"One natural concern, however, about even these highly flexible and adaptive approaches to reach a sense of compromise is that the compromise itself throws the baby of diversity out with the bathwater of conflict.  Yet one of the most interesting properties of systems like eigenvoting or sophisticated forms of liquid democracy is the new kinds of coalitions and representations they might help form.  If one-person-one-vote rules originated from the attempt to avoid conflict by giving the side with greater support a non-violent way to take power, these systems help diffuse conflict based on a more sophisticated theory: that it arises from the consistent reinforcement of existing social divisions by allowing the same groups to consistently form majorities and minorities.  By discounting support from previously affiliated groups, they avoid reinforcing existing conflicts, while creating new ones that cut across these lines, hopefully thereby generating nearly as much diversity as they compromise over, but in directions that avoid entrenching persistent divides."},"315":{"comment":"Yet despite these strengths, even in its richest form, voting expresses and determines preferences about decisions already posed by other social processes.  Some combination of the methods above can completely transform how we understand voting, leaving today's approaches as far behind as the computer left the abacus.  Yet it would fundamentally undermine the richness of our humanity to allow this potential to fool us into believing they can substitute for the need for the richer communication and codesign we have described in previous chapters.  Only in the context of the creative collaborations, deliberations, imaginations, and administrative systems we have sketched can collective decisions be meaningful."},"316":{"comment":"Nor is it likely that, anytime in the near future, voting systems will stretch greatly beyond the national boundaries that currently contain them. The demands of ⿻ identity systems supporting some of the above suggest that while voting in new transnational configurations is imaginable, systems of voting are unlikely any time soon to truly reach global legitimacy.  To truly reach that scope of diversity, we have to turn to the re-imagining of the thinnest of all the substrates for collaboration: market economies."},"317":{"comment":"This book describes a vision for the future of technology and society that we hope is ambitious and serious enough to be real competitor to, but will be more attractive to most readers than, that developed by Libertarians and Technocrats.

From the railroad to the telegraph to the telephone to social media connecting us to old kindergarten friends and new like-minded allies to teleconferencing holding businesses and families together during Covid, we have benefited enormously from technology’s capacity to forge and strengthen human connection while honoring our differences."},"322":{"comment":"Yet, technology has also clearly driven us apart and suppressed our differences. Business models based on a fight for attention have prioritized outrage over curiosity, echo chambers over shared understanding, and proliferated  mis- and disinformation. The rapid spread of information online, out of context and against our privacy expectations, has too often eroded our communities, driven out our cultural heritage and created a global monoculture. As a new generation of technologies including GFMs, Web3 and augmented reality  spreads through our lives, it promises to radically increase technology’s effects, good and bad."},"323":{"comment":"Thus we stand at a crossroads. Technology could drive us apart, sowing chaos and conflict that bring down social order.  It could suppress the human diversity that is its lifeblood, homogenizing us in a singular technical vision.  Or it could dramatically enrich our diversity while strengthening the ties across it, harnessing and sustaining the potential energy of ⿻."},"324":{"comment":"Some would seek to avoid this choice by slamming on the breaks, decelerating technological progress.

That is the aspiration and the imperative of ⿻."},"327":{"comment":"⿻ is thus the third way beyond Libertarianism and Technocracy, just as the life is the third way beyond rigid order and chaos. It is a movement we have perhaps three to five years to set in motion. Within that time frame, a critical mass of the technology that people and companies use every day will have become deeply dependent on \"AI\" and \"the metaverse\". At that point, we won’t be able to reverse the *fait accompli* that Technocracy and Libertarianism have generated for us. But between now and then, we can mobilize to re-chart the course: toward a relationship-centered, empowering digital democracy in which diverse groups of people, precisely because they do not agree, are able to cooperate and collaborate to constantly push our imaginations and aspirations forward."},"328":{"comment":"Such a pivot will take a whole-of-society mobilization. Businesses, governments, universities, and civil society organizations must demand that our technology deepen and broaden our connections across the many forms of diversity, show us that this is possible, build the tools we need to achieve it and make it a reality.  That is the key, and the only path, to strengthening human stability, prosperity, and flourishing into the future. For all that it offers, the internet’s potential for truly transformative progress has never materialized. If we want to realize that potential, we have a brief window of opportunity to act."},"329":{"comment":"Over the last half century, most Western liberal democracies have learned to be helpless in the face of technology. They are intrigued by it and  alternately delighted and frustrated by it, but tend to assume that it emerges inexorably, like modernity itself, instead of as the sum of the choices of small groups of engineers. Most citizens in these polities do not believe “we the people” have any ability, much less any right, to influence the direction of the platforms that are the operating system of our lives."},"330":{"comment":"But we do have the right, and even the duty, to demand better.

This ambition goes to the root of the ⿻ movement’s insight—that personhood, the core unit of democracy, is not merely atomistic or “monistic,” but is also defined by social relationships – and it therefore gives rise to a broader conception of rights, going beyond individual rights to recognize _⿻_ concepts of affiliation, commerce, property, and other building blocks of our society. All these will require fundamental rewriting of a range of technical infrastructures, social relationships and organizing institutions."},"342":{"comment":"Such change  cannot come directly, but instead must follow a gradual process of transformation, occurring in a range of social sectors that build on one another.  To be truly ⿻, these will need to engage and empower people across many lines of difference, which will in turn require that they understand and can articulate what they want from their future.

This can create broad public understanding and expectation of public steering of the direction of technology and diverse social participation its design."},"343":{"comment":"This foundation of ⿻ imagination across lines of difference can empower social and political organization around such goals.

These emergent enterprises can then take on an increasing range of responsibilities legitimately, given their democratic accountability, and blur the lines of responsibility usually assumed for nation states, building a new ⿻ order."},"345":{"comment":"Such enterprise can thus rely on new institutions of research and teaching that will cross disciplinary boundaries and the boundaries between knowledge creation and deployment, engaging deeply with such emerging social enterprises.

Despite mixed findings on whether these algorithms truly exacerbate political polarization and hamper deliberations, it is natural to ask how these systems might be redesigned with the opposite intention of “bridging” the crowd.

Notes are then considered to be “helpful” if this objective quality, rather than the overall ratings, is sufficiently high. Instead of prioritizing notes that are supported by a biased, like-minded cluster of users, the system rewards notes that are supported by diverse groups of users, correcting biases driven by political and social fragmentation.

The recent film, [*Women Talking*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_Talking_(film)), brilliantly captures this spirit in its portrait of a traumatized community coming to a plan for common action through discussion. Groups of friends, clubs, students and teachers, all exchange perspectives, learn, grow, and form a common purpose through in-person talk.  In addition to their interactive nature, in-person interactions often carry elements of richer, non-verbal communication, as participants share a physical context and can perceive many non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions, body language, and gestures, from others in the conversation."},"359":{"comment":"The next oldest and most common communicative form is writing. While far less interactive, writing enables words to travel over much greater distances and time.  Typically conceived as capturing the voice of a single \"author\", written communications can spread broadly, even globally, with the aid of printing and translation. They can endure for thousands of years, allowing for a \"broadcast\" of messages much farther than amphitheaters or loudspeakers can achieve."},"360":{"comment":"This underscores a crucial trade-off: the richness and immediacy of in-person discussions versus the extensive reach and permanence of the written word. Many platforms strive to blend elements of both in-person and written communication by creating a network where in-person conversations serve as links among individuals who are physically and socially proximate, and writing serves as a bridge, connecting people who are geographically distant from each other. The World Cafe [^WorldCafe] or Open Space Technology [^OpenSpaceTechnnology] methods allow dozens or even thousands of people to convene and participate in small groups for dialogue while the written notes from those small clusters are synthesized and distributed broadly.

Furthermore, given that it is impossible for everyone to be heard at length, some notion of representation is necessary for conversation to cross broad social diversity, as we will discuss at length below."},"363":{"comment":"Perhaps the fundamental limit on all these approaches is that while methods of *broadcast* (allowing many to hear a single statement) have dramatically improved, *broad listening* (allowing one person to thoughtfully digest a range of perspectives) remains extremely costly and time consuming.[^Trask]  As economics Nobel Laureate and computer science pioneer Herbert Simon observed, \"(A) wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.\"[^InformationWealth] The cognitive limits on the amount of attention an individual can give, when trying to focus on diverse perspectives, potentially impose sharp trade-offs between diversity and bandwidth, as well as between richness and inclusion."},"364":{"comment":"[^Trask]: To our knowledge, this concept of \"broad listening\" originates with [Andrew Trask](https://iamtrask.github.io/).

Ensuring all participants, whatever their communicative modes and styles, are able to be fully heard requires a range of social technologies and practices, including clear purpose and agenda setting, active inclusion, small group breakouts, careful management of notes (often called the “harvest” of many small group conversations), turn-taking, and encouragement of active listening and often translation and accommodation of differing abilities for auditory and visual communication styles.

These platforms offer unique opportunities for individuals to gain visibility and attention easily through user interactions (e.g., \"likes\" or \"reposts\") and algorithmic ranking systems. This paradigm shift has enabled the diffusion of information among the public, a process once firmly controlled by the editorial procedures of legacy media. However, the effectiveness of these platforms in optimally distributing attention remains a topic of debate. A common drawback is the lack of context and thorough moderation in the diffusion of information, contributing to issues like the spread of \"misinformation\" and \"disinformation,\" and the dominance of well-resourced entities. Moreover, the reliance on algorithmic ranking can inadvertently create \"echo chambers,\" confining users to a narrow stream of content that reflects their existing beliefs, thus limiting their exposure to a diverse range of perspectives and knowledge."},"372":{"comment":"Recent advancements are progressively shifting the dynamics of the trade-offs, enabling more efficient and networked sharing of rich, in-person deliberations.

Community members, with permission from the speakers, lift consequential highlights up to stakeholders, such as government, policy makers or leadership within an organization.

The internet enables collaboration at an extreme scale by reducing the possible space of collaborative actions, such as to buy/sell market transactions, and by utilizing a similar reduction in information transmission, i.e. to five star rating systems.  An effective increase in our ability to transmit and digest information can result in a corresponding increase in our ability to deliberate on difficult and nuanced social issues."},"384":{"comment":"One of the most obvious directions that is a subject of active development is how systems like Polis and Community Notes could be extended with modern graph theory and GFMs.  The \"[Talk to the City](https://ai.objectives.institute/talk-to-the-city)\" project of the [AI Objectives Institute](https://ai.objectives.institute/), for example, illustrates how GFMs can be used to replace a list of statements characterizing a group's views with an interactive agent one can talk to and get a sense of the perspective.  Soon, it should be possible to go further, with GFMs allowing participants to move beyond limited short statements and simple up-and-down votes. Instead, they will be able to fully express themselves in reaction to the conversation. Meanwhile, the models will condense this conversation, making it legible to others who can then participate.  Models could also help look for areas of rough consensus not simply based on common votes but on a natural language understanding of and response to expressed positions. A recent large-scale study highlights the positive impact of such tools in enhancing online democratic discussions. In this experiment, a GFM was used to provide real-time, evidence-based suggestions aimed at refining the quality of political discourse to each participant in the conversation [^LLMDemocracy]. The results indicated a noticeable improvement in the overall quality of conversations, fostering a more democratic, reciprocal exchange of ideas."},"385":{"comment":"While most discussion of bridging systems focuses on building consensus, another powerful role is to support the regeneration of diversity and productive conflict.  On the one hand, they help identify different opinion groups in ways that are not a deterministic function of historical assumptions or identities, potentially allowing these groups to find each other and organize around their perspective.  On the other hand, by surfacing as representing consensus positions that have diverse support, they also create diverse opposition that can coalesce into a new conflict that does not reinforce existing divisions, potentially allowing organization around that perspective.  In short, collective response systems can play just as important a role in mapping and evolving conflict dynamically as helping to navigate it productively."},"386":{"comment":"In a similar spirit, one can imagine harnessing and advancing elements of the design of Community Notes to reshape social media dynamics more holistically.  While the system currently lines up all opinions across the platform on a single spectrum, one can imagine mapping out a range of communities within the platform and harnessing its bridging-based approach not just to prioritize notes, but to prioritize content for attention in the first place.  Furthermore, bridging can be applied at many different scales and to diverse intersecting groups, not just to the platform overall.  One can imagine a future, as we highlight in our [Media](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/6-3/eng/?mode=dark) chapter below, where different content in a feed is highlighted as bridging and being shared among a range of communities one is a member of (a religious community, a physically local community, a political community), reinforcing context and common knowledge and action in a range of social affiliations."},"387":{"comment":"Such dynamic representations of social life could also dramatically improve how we approach representation and selection of participants for deeper deliberation, such as in person or in rich immersive shared realities.  With a richer accounting of relevant social differences, it may be possible to move beyond geography or simple demographics and skills as groups that need to be represented.  Instead, it may be possible to increasingly use the full intersectional richness of identity as a basis for considering inclusion and representation.  Constituencies defined this way could participate in elections or, instead of sortition, protocols could be devised to choose the maximally diverse committees for a deliberation by, for example, choosing a collection of participants that minimizes how marginalized from representation the most marginalized participants are based on known social connections and affiliations.  Such an approach could achieve many of the benefits of sortition, administration and election simultaneously, especially if combined with some of the liquid democracy approaches that we discuss in the voting chapter below."},"388":{"comment":"It may be possible to, in some cases, even more radically re-imagine the idea of representation. GFMs can be \"fine-tuned\" to increasingly accurately mimic the ideas and styles of individuals.[^LLMFinetune] One can imagine training a model on the text of a community of people (as in Talk to the City) and thus, rather than representing one person's perspective, it could operate as a fairly direct collective representative, possibly as an aid, complement or check on the discretion of a person intended to represent that group."},"389":{"comment":"Most boldly, this idea could in principle extend beyond living human beings as we explore further in our [Environment](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/6-4/eng/?mode=dark) chapter below.

Words may be richer symbols than numbers, but they are as dust compared to the richness of human sensory experience, not to mention  proprioception.  \"Words cannot capture\" far more than they can.  Whatever emotional truth it has, it is simply information, so it is theoretically logical that we form far deeper attention in common action and experience than in verbal exchange.  Thus, however far deliberation advances, it cannot substitute for the richer forms of collaboration we have already discussed."},"392":{"comment":"On the opposite side, talk takes time, even in the sophisticated versions we describe.  Many decisions cannot wait for deliberation to fully run its course, especially when great social distance must be bridged, which will generally slow the process.  The other approaches to collaboration we discuss below will address the need for timely decisions typical in many cases."},"393":{"comment":"Many of the ways in which the slow pace of discussion can be overcome (e.g. using LLMs to conduct partially \"in silico\" deliberation) illustrate another important limitation of conversation: other methods are often more easily made transparent and thus broadly legitimate.  The way conversations take inputs and produce outputs are hard to fully describe, whether they occur across people or in machines.  In fact, one could consider inputting natural language to a machine and producing a machine dictation as just a more sophisticated, non-linear form of voting.  But, in contrast to the administrative and voting rules we will discuss in the next two chapters, it might be very hard to achieve common understanding and legitimacy on how this transformation takes place and thus make it the basis for common action in the way that voting and markets often are.  Thus, checks on the way deliberations occur and are observed arising from those other systems are likely to be important for a long time to come."},"394":{"comment":"Furthermore, deliberation in the democratic process is also limited by the ability for humans to practically audit more capable GFMs. GFMs have also been demonstrated to adhere to instructions blindly in a way that may lead them to censor some perspectives.[^LLMCensorship] To be properly  ⿻ models mus offer a diverse array of reasonable responses, enabling them to adapt and reflect various perspectives, and ensuring they are accurately calibrated to the nuances of specific populations."},"395":{"comment":"Lastly, deliberation is sometimes idealized as helping overcome divisions and reach a true \"common will\".  Yet, while reaching points of overlapping and rough consensus is crucial for common action, so too is the regeneration of diversity and productive conflict to fuel dynamism and ensure productive inputs to future deliberations.  Thus, deliberations and their balance with other modes of collaboration must always attend, as we have illustrated above, to this stimulus to productive conflict as much as it does to the resolution of conflict and the mitigation of explosive conflict."},"396":{"comment":"[^CNDiversity]: Junsol Kim, Zhao Wang, Haohan Shi, Hsin-Keng Ling, and James Evans, \"Individual misinformation tagging reinforces echo chambers; Collective tagging does not,\" _arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.11282_ (2023), [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11282](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11282)."},"397":{"comment":"[^TradeoffDiversity]: Sinan Aral, and Marshall Van Alstyne, \"The diversity-bandwidth trade-off,\" American journal of sociology 117, no. 1 (2011): 90-171."},"398":{"comment":"[^InformationWealth]: Herbert Simon, “Designing Organizations for an Information-Rich World,” In _Computers, Communications, and the Public Interest_, edited by Martin Greenberger, 38–72.

The leading example of this was the Augmentation Research Center established by Douglas Engelbart at Stanford.[^DouglasEngelbart] On the other hand, he dubbed the network of collaboration between these hubs, with his usual tongue-in-cheek, the \"[Intergalactic Computer Network](https://worrydream.com/refs/Licklider_1963_-_Members_and_Affiliates_of_the_Intergalactic_Computer_Network.pdf)\", and hoped it would provide a model of computer-mediated collaboration and co-governance.[^Memo]"},"426":{"comment":"[^Memo]: J.C.R.

Shortly following Lick's departure (in 1965), Taylor moved to IPTO to help develop Lick's networking vision under the leadership of Ivan Sutherland, who then returned to academia, leaving Taylor in charge of IPTO and the network that he more modestly labeled the ARPANET. He used his authority to commission Lick's former home of BBN to build the first working prototype of the ARPANET backbone. With momentum growing through Engelbart's demonstration of personal computing and ARPANET's first successful trials, Lick and Taylor articulated their vision for the future possibilities of personal and social computing in their 1968 article \"[The Computer as a Communication Device](https://moodlearchive.epfl.ch/2021-2022/pluginfile.php/2704820/mod_resource/content/3/LickliderApr68.pdf)\", describing much of what would become the culture of personal computing, internet and even smartphones several decades later.[^Communication]"},"429":{"comment":"[^Communication]: J.C.R.

Ted Nelson trained as a sociologist, was inspired in his work by a visit to campus he hosted in 1959 by cybernetic pioneer Margaret Mead's vision of democratic and pluralistic media and developed into. an artist. Following these early experiences, he devoted his life beginning in his early 20s to the development of \"[Project Xanadu](https://www.xanadu.net/)\", which aimed to create a revolutionary human-centered interface for computer networks. While [Xanadu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqx6li5dbEY) had so many components that Nelson considered indispensable that it was not released fully until the 2010s, its core idea, co-developed with Engelbart, was \"hypertext\" as Nelson labeled it."},"441":{"comment":"Nelson imagined hypertext as a way to liberate communication from the tyranny of a linear interpretation imposed by an original author, empowering a \"[pluralism](https://cs.brown.edu/people/nmeyrowi/LiteraryMachinesChapter2.pdf)\" (as he labeled it) of paths through material through a network of (bidirectional) links connecting material in a variety of sequences.[^Nelson] This \"choose your own adventure\"[^ChooseYourOwnAdventure] quality is most familiar today to internet users in their browsing experiences but showed up earlier in commercial products in the 1980s (such as computer games based on hypercard). Nelson imagined that such ease of navigation and recombination would enable the formation of new cultures and narratives at unprecedented speed and scope. The power of this approach became apparent to the broader world when Tim Berners-Lee made it central to his \"[World Wide Web](https://www.w3.org/History.html)\" approach to navigation in the early 1990s, ushering in the era of broad adoption of the internet."},"442":{"comment":"[^Nelson]: Theodor Holm Nelson, _Literary Machines_ (Self-published, 1981), available at https://cs.brown.edu/people/nmeyrowi/LiteraryMachinesChapter2.pdf"},"443":{"comment":"While Engelbart and Nelson were lifelong friends and shared many similar visions, they took very different paths to realizing them, each of which (as we will see) held an important seed of truth.

Nelson was an artistic purist whose relentless pursuit over decades of Xanadu embodying all of his [seventeen enumerated principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu#Original_17_rules) buried his career."},"444":{"comment":"As an active participant in Lick's network, Engelbart conversely tempered his ambition with the need to persuade other network nodes to support, adopt or at least inter-operate with his approach. As different user interfaces and networking protocols proliferated, retreated from the pursuit of perfection. Engelbart, and even more his colleagues across the project, instead began to develop a culture of collegiality, facilitated by the communication network the were building, across the often competing universities they worked at. The physical separation made tight coordination of networks impossible, but work to ensure minimal inter-operation and spreading of clear best practices became a core characteristic of the ARPANET community."},"445":{"comment":"This culture manifested in the development of the \"Request for Comments\" (RFC) process by Steve Crocker, arguably one of the first \"wiki\"-like processes of informal and mostly additive collaboration across many geographically and sectorally (governmental, corporate, university) dispersed collaborators. This in turn contributed to the common Network Control Protocol and, eventually, Transmission Control and Internet Protocols (TCP/IP) under the famously mission-driven but inclusive and responsive leadership of Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn between 1974 when TCP was first circulated as RFC 675 and 1983 when they became the official ARPANET protocols. At the core of the approach was the vision of a \"network of networks\" that gave the \"internet\" its name: that many diverse and local networks (at universities, corporations and government agencies) could inter-operate sufficiently to permit the near-seamless communication across long distances, in contrast to centralized networks (such as France's concurrent Minitel) that were standardized from the top down by a government.[^Minitel] Together these three dimensions of networking (of technical communication protocols, communicative content and governance of standards) converged to create the internet we know today."},"446":{"comment":"Much of what resulted from this project is so broadly known it hardly bears repeating here. During the 1970's, Taylor's Xerox PARC produced a series of expensive, and thus commercially unsuccessful, but revolutionary \"personal workstations\" that incorporated much of what became the personal computer of the 1990s. At the same time, as computer components were made available to broader populations, businesses like Apple and Microsoft began to make cheaper and less user-friendly machines available broadly. Struggling to commercialize its inventions, Xerox allowed Apple Co-Founder Steve Jobs access to its technology in exchange for a stake, resulting in the Macintosh's ushering in of modern personal computing and Microsoft's subsequent mass scaling through their Windows operating system.

Under the leadership of Kahn and Cerf and with support from ARPA (now renamed DARPA to emphasize its \"defense\" focus), these networks began to harness the TCP/IP protocol to inter-operate. As this network scaled, DARPA looked for another agency to maintain it, given the limits of its advanced technology mission. While many US government agencies took their hand, the National Science Foundation had the widest group of scientific participants and their NSFNET quickly grew to be the largest network, leading ARPANET to be decommissioned in 1990. At the same time, NSFNET began to interconnect with networks in other wealthy countries."},"450":{"comment":"One of those was the United Kingdom, where researcher Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 proposed a \"web browser\", \"web server\" and a Hypertext Mark-Up Language (HTML) that fully connected hypertext to packet-switching and made internet content far more available to a broad set of end users. From the launch of Berners-Lee's World Wide Web (WWW) in 1991, internet usage grew from roughly 4 million people (mostly in North America) to over 400 million (mostly around the world) by the end of the millennium.

Stuck on his decades-long quest for the ideal networking and communication system, Nelson ceaselessly warned of the insecurity, exploitative structure and inhumane features of the emerging WWW design. Without secure identity systems (Xanadu Principles 1 and 3), a mixture of anarchy and land-grabs by nation states and corporate actors would be inevitable. Without embedded protocols for commerce (Xanadu Principles 9 and 15), online work would become devalued or the financial system controlled by monopolies. Without better structures for secure information sharing and control (Xanadu Principles 8 and 16), both surveillance and information siloing would be pervasive. Whatever its apparent success, the WWW-Internet was doomed to end badly."},"452":{"comment":"While Nelson was something of an oddball, his concerns were surprisingly broadly shared among even the mainstream internet pioneers who would seem to have every reason to celebrate their success. As early as 1980, while TCP/IP was coalescing, Lick foresaw in his classic essay \"Computers and Government\" \"two scenarios\" (one good, the other bad) for the future of computing: it could be dominated and its potential stifled by monopolistic corporate control or there could be a full societal mobilization that made computing serve and support democracy.[^ComputGov] In the former scenario, Lick projected all kinds of social ills, one that might make the advent of the information age a net detractor to democratic social flourishing. These included:"},"453":{"comment":"1. Pervasive surveillance and public distrust of government.2. Paralysis of government's ability to regulate or enforce laws, as they fall behind the dominant technologies citizens use.3. Debasement of creative professions.4.

Government data and statistics becoming increasingly inaccurate and irrelevant."},"454":{"comment":"The wider internet adoption spread, the the less relevant such complaints appeared. Government did not end up playing as central of a role as he imagined, but by 2000 most of the few commentators who were even aware of his warnings assumed we were surely on the path of Lick's scenario 2. Yet in a few places, concern was growing by late in the first decade of the new millennium. Virtual reality pioneer Jaron Lanier sounded the alarm in two books _[You are Not a Gadget](https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-Gadget-Manifesto/dp/0307389979)_ and _[Who Owns The Future?](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Who-Owns-the-Future/Jaron-Lanier/9781451654974)_, highlighting Nelson's and his own version of Lick's concerns about the future of the internet.[^Jaron] While these initially appeared simply an amplification of Nelson's fringe ideas, a series of world events that we discuss in the [Information Technology and Democracy: a Widening Gulf](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/2-0/eng/?mode=dark) above eventually brought much of the world around to seeing the limitations of the internet economy and society that had developed, helping ignite the Techlash.

On the one hand, with the rise of \"small government conservatism\" that would later be labeled \"neoliberalism\", government was retreating from proactively funding and shaping industry and technology. On the other hand, the Vietnam War turned much of the left against the role of the defense establishment in shaping research, leading to the [Mansfield Amendments](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-06430-4_6) of 1970, 1971 and 1973 that prohibited ARPA from funding any research not directly related to the \"defense function\".[^Mansfield] Together these were redirecting DARPA's focus to technologies like cryptography and artificial intelligence that were seen as directly supporting military objectives."},"458":{"comment":"[^Mansfield]: Phil Williams, \"Whatever Happened to the Mansfield Amendment?\" _Survival: Global Politics and Strategy_ 18, no. 4 (1976): 146-153 and \"The Mansfield Amendment of 1971\" in _The Senate and US Troops in Europe_ (London, Palgrave Macmillan: 1985): pp. 169-204."},"459":{"comment":"Yet even if the attention of the US government had not shifted, the internet was quickly growing out of its purview and control.

A small group of telecommunications companies took over the internet backbone that the NSF freely relinquished. Web portals, like America Online and Prodigy came to dominate most Americans' interactions with the web, as Netscape and Microsoft vied to dominate web browsing. The neglected identity functions were filled by the rise of Google and Facebook. Absent digital payments were filled in by PayPal and Stripe.

Cryptocurrencies have been one of the focal technologies of the last decade. But only slightly less heralded and far more broadly adopted have been a range of government and other public payments innovations including instant payment technologies using government identities in places like [India] (https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi/product-overview), [Brazil](https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/financialstability/pix_en) and [Singapore](https://www.abs.org.sg/consumer-banking/fast), central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and regulated inter-operable digital payment systems like those used in the People's Republic of China (PRC).

Cash is perhaps one of the \"dumbest\" technologies of the pre-digital era: it is a single, homogeneous substance transmitted between roughly anonymous, abstracted accounts. While it has proven far harder to replicate this basic function, and thus recent advances are important, this is not a revolutionary technique enabled by digital technology as, for example, hypertext improved on what had been possible in previous writing. In this chapter, we will summarize progress thus far, discuss the limitations of traditional money compared to higher aspirations for commerce online, and discuss ways to build on recent advances to allow a more ⿻ vision of digital commerce."},"517":{"comment":"While the early history of money has been the subject of a great deal of recent research, to which we will return below, most people associate the idea with currency in the form of tokens or notes that pass from one hand to another and view other forms of money as abstractions of this more basic concept. This form of \"money of exchange\" dates back to the early civilizations of Babylon, India and China and in the first millennium BC was increasingly based on precious metals like bronze, silver and gold.[^Davies] The durability, scarcity and wide belief in the value of these metals facilitated broad acceptance of them in payment for a range of goods and services."},"518":{"comment":"Yet none of these properties pertain exclusively to precious metals and their use as currency detracted from more practical applications, whether to weapons, machinery or decorations. This led many societies to move away from the direct use of precious metals to other representations of their value that could be made scarce but had no direct use, including commercial receipts, bank notes and government-issued paper that was deemed \"legal tender\" and thus mandated to be accepted for its face value."},"519":{"comment":"Closely connected was the development of banks, which held currency and other valuables that they promised to return on demand, using these deposits to fund lending to others. Because banks are rarely simultaneously called on to return the full set of deposits, they began to lend out more than they had on deposit, giving rise to a system of \"fractional reserve banking\" and making banks a source of the creation of new money. While the obvious dangers of a bank run this creates are not a topic we have space to focus on here, they created a natural role for \"central banks\" to help control this process of money creation and avoid banking collapses."},"520":{"comment":"By the early twentieth century, the overwhelming majority of money was held as accounts, rather than currency (paper or otherwise). Given its rigid denominations and bulk, currency is only effective for relatively small transactions. In parallel to, and arguably earlier than currency, directed transfers between bank accounts with flexible denominations developed, typically called \"cheques\" today. By the mid-twentieth century, these had become the dominant (by aggregate value) method of funds transfer. Cheques came, and come, in a variety of forms, some more reliant on information exchanges across banks and others operating more similarly to cash (unconditional and undirected value transfers)."},"521":{"comment":"Cheques, of course, have familiar disadvantages of being slow to both fill out and in order to clear must be sent around physically.

This created an effective financial screen for participation. On the other hand, they rewarded \"honest\" participants (those whose recording of transactions matches others') with \"coins\" created by including transactions to their own accounts.

Even the US has followed with [FedNow](https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/fednow) in 2023. While there are still significant impediments to international inter-operation, there is an increasing consensus that the immediate gap in making instant payments online and in person through digital channels has been met."},"540":{"comment":"Yet the challenges raised by cryptocurrencies cannot be laid to rest quite so easily, as suggested by the resilience of interest and recent currency values in the space. The decline of cash, heralded by defenders of sanction regimes and battlers against financial criminals like economist Kenneth Rogoff, has been bemoaned by privacy advocates and civil libertarians, who argue that the collapse of private payments will have systemic effects individual users fail to account for when choosing how to pay.[^Priv] The oft-touted privacy benefits of Bitcoin have largely proven illusory given that it has become increasingly easy for well-resourced analysts to uncover the controllers of pseudonymous accounts.[^Bitcoinprivacy] However, interest in privacy technology has become a primary focus in the space, stimulating the development of highly private currencies like [Zcash](https://z.cash/) and \"mixer\" services like [Tornado cash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_Cash) on top of other currencies. These have stimulated controversy over the trade-offs between privacy and legal accountability, leading to forceful government actions to shut down various privacy features in some jurisdictions. These conflicts have also been at the root of the challenges of achieving seamless international inter-operation for digital payments systems, as countries fight over who can surveil and regulate what activity."},"542":{"comment":"Many of these challenges arise from the same kinds of misspecification of issues usually labeled \"privacy\" that we highlighted in our identity chapter. There is wide agreement, on the one hand, that financial transactions should be protected from inappropriate surveillance. On the other hand, there is a similarly wide agreement that, with appropriate checks and balances, it should be possible to hold individuals and organizations accountable for facilitating criminal activity. The question of how these can be reconciled is essentially the same as those we addressed in the previous chapter: how can a diversity of informational communities partially interoperate while maintaining their integrity?"},"543":{"comment":"After all, financial transactions can never be purely private: they always involve several parties and are at least partly detectable by others in a community where the inflow of transactions affects the economic environment. The goal, then, is not privacy as much as it is contextual integrity: ensuring that this information stays within the affected community unless it is having important and widely recognized spillover effects on other communities (precisely what fiduciary duties, financial and business ethics and, when necessary, law enforcement is meant to capture). And, if it is, it is the community's responsibility to either ensure their culture is not supporting such externally harmful activity or to defend their right to support it if the external claim is unjust.[^pools] The essence of ⿻ \"checks and balances\" is that the communities involved must become partly aware and involved in such external surveillance, rather than it being asymmetrically and externally imposed."},"544":{"comment":"[^pools]: Recently, interest in explicitly creating communities for such purposes has grown in the Web3 world.

Little surveillance is mere voyeurism. Instead, it is intended to prevent a range of financial crimes, from fraud to trading with aggressors against international law (sanctions). Beyond such dramatic transgressions, a range of transactions legitimately matter for people other than the transacting parties: sales of drugs and weapons, taking on unreported debts that burden someone's ability to repay other debts, taxable sales, and much more. All this suggests why the anonymous and unaccountable image of cash and centralized control by a government of accounts are both insufficient ways to understand a ⿻ system of commercial trust."},"546":{"comment":"Imagining a more ⿻ alternative brings us back to the history of money and why it evolved in the first place. In his account of the institution, the late anthropological historian David Graeber articulated the view of many of the leading scholars of money such as R. G. Hawtrey, Geoffrey Ingham, L. Randall Wray and Samuel A. Chambers to argue that long before money, societies engaged in a range of mutually beneficial collaboration under norms of reciprocity.[^Debt] These were rarely quantified in terms of formal \"value\" and followed a range of logics beyond simple bilateral favor trading. For example, the community services of a hunter for a village or an elder might put the community in general in their \"debt\", making gifts to them customary. The richness and diversity of these traditions made their quantification unnatural, but also hard to extend beyond the Dunbar number we discussed in the [Identity and Personhood](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-1/eng/?mode=dark) chapter of roughly 150 close associates."},"547":{"comment":"As collaboration and exchange extended across larger distances, times or groups, quantification and recording of debts owed and value given became necessary to manage the complexity. While it seems that the earliest such accounts attempted to record the specifics of a debt in terms of the good or service offered, this similarly became quickly unmanageable and common units of quantification were used to simplify accounting and produce the first notions of \"currency\". Media of exchange, banks, and their notes and various of the other forms of money we discussed above grew as ways of making these accounts more portable. \"Credit\" thus was more primary than \"cash\"."},"548":{"comment":"But if currency arose as a simplification to deal with the limits of pre-modern information technology, the natural question is whether one might do much better today. Recording more about transactions and other forms of value creation is not just possible today; it is a routine part of most electronic commerce. Reducing all this to a transfer of money is no longer a necessary simplification, it is a projection of an antiquated historical ritual."},"549":{"comment":"Nor is the role of money as a solvent in socially long-distance trust particularly relevant today. One of the most common stories economists tell for the advantage of money-based exchanges is \"the double coincidence of wants\": Person A may have something B wants, but the other may not have anything to directly offer in exchange. Money allows them to easily offer goods or services to C, who may have something A wants, without having to assemble the full group. Yet the role of money in avoiding the need for such \"trading cycles\" is dated: in fact, economists today regularly use \"trading cycles\" algorithms directly in a variety of contexts without relying on money, given that modern computation makes them cheap to perform.[^TTC]"},"550":{"comment":"[^TTC]: Alvin E. Roth, Tayfun Sönmez and M. Utku Ünver, \"Kidney Exchange\", _Quarterly Journal of Economics_ 119, no. 2 (2004): 457-488."},"551":{"comment":"Similarly, as we noted in the [Identity and Personhood](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-1/eng/?mode=dark) chapter, it may once have been necessary to offer someone in a distant land a widely valued token, such as gold, instead of a promise to offer a gift in the future, given the low likelihood of a future exchange. Yet such shorthand is far less important today: with everyone within six degrees of social separation and the accounting for relational trust computationally trivial, today it would be almost as easy to harness interpersonal \"debts\" in chains of relationships directly as to transfer funds."},"552":{"comment":"A natural question is whether harnessing these new capabilities adds anything meaningful. While we will reserve a detailed discussion of applications of ⿻ commerce and trust to the [next part of this book](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-7/eng/?mode=dark), it is not hard to imagine why such information is important in appropriately allocating the trust and influence that money confers. Someone who has conferred many small benefits across a local community, but interacted little outside of it, and is single has a very different profile of appropriate social favor than someone who is deeply devoted to their family and profession but has few extra-familial social connections in a large city. These two may deserve the same \"degree\" of social esteem (if quantifying such is even useful), but the esteem is of very different kinds. The former, for example, would be a far more plausible civic or political leader in her community, while the latter would naturally be entitled to professional esteem and a degree of material comfort."},"553":{"comment":"Furthermore, the very economic theory that typically justified the relevance of money confirms this intuition, when applied to social reality. Under certain well-studied conditions, money held by individuals suffices to track value creation. But these conditions require that all goods are private (everything can be consumed by one individual and others' consuming it prevents them from doing so) and production is \"submodular\", meaning that combining a group of people or assets produces less than the sum of what they could produce separately (the whole is less than the sum of the parts). If, on the other hand, consumption is at least partly social and production may be super-modular, money is a poor or even hopeless way to keep track of value."},"554":{"comment":"An open-source software (OSS) project is an example. Collaboration among multiple individuals often creates greater value than individual actions alone. It is a supermodular production. And the resulting products are replicated and provide utility to many people. It is social consumption. In these situations, money-based management does not function well. Consider a scenario where two individuals collaborate to create value and both actions are necessary. There is no simple or obvious way to divide any value created among these contributors; the value created is fundamentally joint. Furthermore, if the two participants could engage in multiple possible joint projects, which to prioritize depends on the preferences of both, making choices fundamentally collective, decisions that require logic closer to that of voting than commerce.[^supermodular]"},"555":{"comment":"More broadly, in practice, as sociologists have extensively documented, social influence _does_ in practice work in these richer ways. People vote, gain esteem and authority, and develop reputations in a range of contexts: a doctor's lab coat, the standing of an athlete, awards for prestigious academic papers, etc. All of these are sources of influence and command deference from those who regard them highly, allowing the bearer of these marks of status to achieve things someone without them could not."},"556":{"comment":"Of course, these systems are not entirely separate from the commercial sphere: reputations for leadership, nobility, or skill can (sometimes) be monetized by, for example, advertising against or charging for access to the person holding the prestige or by using trust to establish a commercial enterprise harnessing it. But none of these conversions are simple or linear, and, in fact, if one is seen to directly \"sell\" one's social standing such as \"selling out\" or \"corruption\", it can quickly undermine that standing. Clearly, therefore, the simplest ideas of \"sales\" and \"conversion\" are not effective ways to allow money to inter-operate with these other \"symbolic media\". This makes money nearly useless as a way to quantify, make transparent and scale these other systems.

For example, two universities in the same town might allow exchanges between their meal programs. But it would be against the rules or perhaps even technically impossible for a holder to sell the community currency for broader currency without community consent.[^PluralMoney] In fact, it was the proliferation of experiments with various currencies, some of them with similar intentions, that inspired then-_Bitcoin Magazine_ writer Vitalik Buterin to conceive Ethereum as a platform for such experimentation, though challenges with secure identities have limited community currency experiments as they make it too easy to sell an account and thus circumvent controls on prohibited transfers.[^DeSoc]"},"559":{"comment":"[^PluralMoney]: For more elaboration of this idea, see https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/plural-money/.[^DeSoc]: Ohlhaver, Weyl and Buterin, op. cit."},"560":{"comment":"Such a community currency played a central role in the creation of this book.

In such a system, rather than receiving payment for a good or service, people would effectively \"call in a favor\" from someone who owes one to them. If you need something from someone who does not owe you a favor, you would leverage the principle of six degrees of separation in the network of \"favors owed\", as discussed in the Identity chapter. Many potential paths of such favors could be calculated and the total amount of \"credit\" one can get would be computed by classical computer science algorithms for calculating the \"maximum flow\" ([maxflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem)) that can flow between two points in a network. While such calculations are obviously impractical for people to make on the fly when they want to buy a coffee, they are trivial for a computer network.

On the one hand, government-issued identities are foundational to modern life and often intended to avoid invasions of privacy.  On the other hand, they do a poor job protecting identity because they are used across so many contexts that they cannot be kept secret and are founded on thin signals. Furthermore, as we discuss below, these problems are currently being exacerbated by the advance of technologies, like generative foundation models (GFMs), which can easily imitate and modify content and draw sophisticated inferences from public signals.  Additionally, the process of creating digital versions of these IDs has been slow and inconsistent across jurisdictions.  For all these reasons, existing physical (paper or plastic) government-issued IDs are in an increasingly precarious position and offer quite an unattractive trade-off between establishment and protection."},"600":{"comment":"A second group of widely used identity systems is account management for the leading technology platforms such as [Meta](https://auth.meta.com), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com), Microsoft ([Microsoft Accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_account), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com), [GitHub](https://www.github.com)), [Alphabet](https://www.google.com/account/about/), [Apple](https://support.apple.com/apple-id) and others.

Banking is typically regulated by the government and requires government-issued ID before you can enroll (a process known as \"know your customer\" or KYC). Telecommunications providers often ask for government-issued ID to support effective account management (where do we send the bill) and recovery (I lost my phone. Yes it is me.) and in some countries they are required to know who their customers are before they can get a phone number.  Both banks and telephone companies are privately administered and linked to rich user data that can be harnessed for security, and thus often become a crucial input to other identity systems (like SSO systems), but are typically far more regulated than SSO systems and thus typically have greater legitimacy and portability across private providers. In many contexts these systems are thus viewed as a useful combination of security and legitimacy, anchoring ultimate security for many services through multi-factor authentication.

Linking such a wide variety of interactions to a single identifier associated with a set of biometrics from a single individual collected at enrollment (or registration) forces a stark trade-off.  On the one hand, if (as in Aadhaar) the administrators of the program are constantly using biometrics for authentication, they become able to link or see activities to these done by the person who the identifier points to, gaining an unprecedented capacity to surveil citizen activities across a wide range of domains and, potentially, to undermine or target the identities of vulnerable populations.[^ZKAadhar]  Activists have raised concerns over this issue have been repeatedly raised in relation to the status of the Muslim minority in India."},"622":{"comment":"[^ZKAadhar]: It is worth noting, however, that if such systems are augmented with cryptography such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), they can partially protect the user's privacy.

Work on \"decentralized identity\" grew from many of the concerns about digital identity we have highlighted above: fragmentation, lack of natural digital infrastructure, issues with privacy, surveillance and corporate control. A key founding document was Microsoft identity architect Kim Cameron's \"Laws of Identity\" [^LawsOfIdentities], which emphasized the importance of user control/consent, minimal disclosure to appropriate parties, multiple use cases, pluralism of participation, integration with human users and consistency of experience across context. Kim Cameron worked on developing the cardspace [^CS] system while at MSFT and this became the InformationCard [^icard] standards. These did not get market adoption in part because they were too early - smartphones were not widely adopted yet and the idea that this device could hold a wallet for people."},"626":{"comment":"The emergence of blockchain-distributed ledgers renewed interest in the decentralized identity community on achieving individual control over identifiers rather than being excessively tied to a single issue. This spurred the creation of the Decentralized Identifiers (DID) standard at the W3C that defines a way to have decentralized globally resolvable endpoints with associated public keys.[^DID] This creates a way to grant individuals \"ownership\" over identities, rooted in \"public\" data repositories such as blockchains, and create standardized formats for a variety of entities to issue digital credentials referencing these identifiers."},"627":{"comment":"The systems have the flexibility to allow individuals to have multiple accounts/pseudonyms. They also share a common practical challenge, namely that for an individual to truly \"own\" their identity, they must either control some ultimate key that gives them access to it and/or be able to reliably recover that key without resorting to some higher, controlling authority. Other than possibly biometrics (the problems with which we discussed above), there is no widely agreed method to allow recovery without a trusted authority and no example of keys that individuals have been reliably able to self-manage in large, diverse societies."},"628":{"comment":"Despite these common challenges, the details of these schemes vary dramatically, however. On one extreme, advocates of \"verifiable credentials\" (VCs) prioritize privacy and the ability of users to control which of the claims about them are presented at any time. On the other extreme, advocates of \"soulbound tokens\" (SBTs) or other blockchain-centric identity systems emphasize the importance of credentials that are public commitments to e.g. repay a loan or not produce further replicas of a work of art and thus require that the claims be publicly tied to an identity. Here, again, in both the challenges around recovery and the DID/VC-SBT debate we see the unattractive trade-off between establishing and protecting identities."},"629":{"comment":"Is there a way past this seemingly irreconcilable conflict, ensuring the secure establishment and strong protection of identity without centralized surveillance?

Biometrics (e.g. iris scans, fingerprints, genetic information) is a detailed set of physical information that uniquely identifies a person and that in principle anyone with access to that person and appropriate technology may ascertain.  Yet people are not just biological but sociological beings.  Far richer than their biometric profile is the set of shared histories and interactions they have with other people and social groups.  These may include biometrics; after all, anytime we meet someone in person we at least partly perceive their biometrics, and they may leave traces of others behind.

For almost anything we might want to prove to a stranger, there is some combination of people and institutions (typically many) who can \"vouch\" for this information without any dedicated strategy of surveillance. For example, a person wanting to prove that they are above a particular age could call on friends who have known them for a long time, the school they attended, doctors who verified their age at various times as well, of course, on governments who verified their age. Such ⿻ attribute verification systems are fairly common: when applying for some forms of government identification many jurisdictions allow a variety of attribute-proving methods for addresses including bank statements, utility bills, leases, etc."},"636":{"comment":"* Privacy:  Perhaps even more interestingly, all of these \"issuers\" of attributes know this information from interactions that most of us feel consistent with \"privacy\": we do not get concerned about the co-knowledge of these social facts in the way we would surveillance by a corporation or government.  However, we will be more precise in the next chapter about the sense in which these (should/could) approaches allay privacy concerns."},"637":{"comment":"* Progressive authentication: While standard verification by a single factor allows the user to gain confidence in the attested fact/attribute equal to their confidence in the verifying party/system, such ⿻ systems allow a wide range of confidence to be achieved by drawing on more and more trusted issuers of attributes.  This allows adaptation to a variety of use cases based on the security they require."},"638":{"comment":"* Security: ⿻ also avoids many of the problems of a \"single point of failure\".  The corruption of even several individuals and institutions only affects those who rely on them, which may be a very small part of society, and even for them, the redundancy described above implies they may only suffer a partial reduction in the verification they can achieve.  This is particularly important given the potential risks (as mentioned above) to e.g. biometric systems from advances in AI and printing technology.  Given the basis of other verification methods above are much more diverse (a range of communicative acts, physical encounters, etc.) the chances of these all failing based on a particular technological advance are far less likely."},"639":{"comment":"* Recovery: This approach also offers a natural solution to one of the most challenging problems above: the recovery of lost credentials.  As noted there, recovery typically relies on interactions with a single, powerful entity that can investigate the validity of a claim to an account; alternatives based on giving individuals full \"ownership\" are usually highly susceptible to hacking or other attacks.  Yet a natural alternative would be for individuals to rely on a group of relationships allowing, for example, 3 of 5 friends or institutions to recover their key.

This is why some of the leading organizations seeking to achieve a future like this, such as the [Trust over IP Foundation](https://trustoverip.org/), draw tight analogies to the history of the creation of the internet protocols themselves.

Yet there are several natural approaches to addressing this complexity.  One is to harness the growing capacity of GFMs, trained to adapt to the relationships and context of the individual or institution using the model, to extract meaning from such diverse signals; we discuss this possibility extensively in a [later chapter](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-5/eng/?mode=dark) on Adaptive Administration.  Another approach is to limit the number of relationships any individual or institution has to manage and rely on either institutions of medium size (e.g. medium businesses, churches, etc.) that play intermediary roles (which Jaron Lanier and one of us have called \"mediators of individual data or [MIDs](https://hbr.org/2018/09/a-blueprint-for-a-better-digital-society)) or on \"friends of friends\" relationships (which we call \"transitive trust\") which are known to connect, within a small number of links (roughly six), almost any two people on earth.[^MIDs]  We will discuss the appeal, trade-offs and compatibility between these two approaches below."},"645":{"comment":"* Trust at a distance: Another closely related problem is that many of the natural verifiers for strangers we meet may be people who we do not know ourselves.

We will return in a [future chapter](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-5/eng/?mode=dark) to the potential role of GFMs.  Focusing instead on firmly network-based approaches, the two natural strategies correspond to the two types of networks that in [The Lost Dao](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/3-3/eng/?mode=dark) we recounted internet pioneer Paul Baran imagining: \"decentralization\" (also called \"[polycentrism](https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352)\", which we will use), where there are many verifiers of significant size but not so many as to create overwhelming complexity, or \"distribution\", where there are few larger-scale verifiers and we instead use transitive trust to span social distances.[^poly]  A basic heuristic that is useful to keep in mind in considering all these possibilities is the \"[Dunbar number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number)\".  This is the number (usually around 150) of people that an anthropologist, Robin Dunbar, argued people could maintain stable relationships with absent significant information technology.[^Dunbar]  Whatever the precise number is, it seems clear most people cannot manage more than a few hundred relationships, evaluation of reputation, etc. without significant technological assistance."},"649":{"comment":"[^poly]: Cameron, op. cit.[^Dunbar]:R.I.M.

While this obviously limits ⿻ some, it is not a major problem as long as participants maintain a reasonable diversity of affiliations.  Suppose, for example, that we have a population of 10 billion, and each person maintains 100 relationships with potentially verifying institutions (e.g. governments, churches, employers etc.).  Suppose that to have a reasonable chance for verification to work, any two-person meeting must share at least 5 overlapping memberships.  If memberships are randomly distributed, 300 verifiers could co-exist and still allow the chance that verification fails for any random pair of individuals to be one in several million.  Of course, individuals who meet are rarely random nor do they form their affiliations randomly, nor are 5 overlapping memberships likely to be absolutely necessary for most interactions, especially among people meeting randomly.  All of these suggest many more verifiers could thrive in such an environment of ⿻ memberships."},"651":{"comment":"Yet this number would clearly be far smaller than the population size, perhaps around 100,000, the number with the property that goes into 10 billion 100,000 times.  This would be vastly more ⿻ than our current identity landscape, allowing a far better trade-off between autonomy/control and functionality/security.  But is even more possible?"},"652":{"comment":"One of the most important discoveries in quantitative sociology is that, despite Dunbar-like limits, by traversing a few degrees of separation most humans are connected to each other.  To see how this is possible, suppose that each of us can only maintain 100 relationships.  This would imply that we might have 100^2=10,000 second-degree relationships, 100^3=1,000,000 third-degree relationships, 100^4=100,000,000 fourth-degree relationships and 100^5=10,000,000,000 fifth-degree relationships, greater than the global population.  Thus it is entirely possible that each of us could be within 5 degrees of separation from every other person on the planet.  Given that some of these relationships will, at any level, overlap, the number of degrees of separation should be somewhat larger: most sociological studies have found roughly 6 degrees of separation between any two randomly chosen people.[^Sep]  Furthermore, at least if one goes to chains of 7, there are usually many mostly independent chains of social connection between any two people."},"653":{"comment":"Furthermore, the idea of establishing relationships, information and validity through transitive chains is ancient and common.  It lies behind the concept of an introduction, the game \"telephone\" (which emphasizes some of its limitations) and the popular professional social network LinkedIn.  Finding and managing the many possible chains of introductions between socially distant people clearly requires some technical support, but nothing much greater than has already been shown possible by computer science research where it is known as the classical \"maximum flow\" problem.  The problem is actually quite similar to that underlying the packet switching that powers the internet."},"654":{"comment":"Furthermore, the decentralized and distributed strategies can be combined to greatly amplify each other.  To take a simple example, consider our suggestion above that there might be 100,000 issuers of attributes.  In a world of 10 billion, each would have to be managing relationships with 100,000 participants, on average.  If they were also able to manage a similar number of relationships with other issuers, every issuer would have a direct relationship with every other issuer.  Two degrees of separation could do far more, allowing millions of issuing organizations to thrive under the same logic that can leverage the attributes from other issuers to do verification.    Thus a mixture of transitive trust and polycentrism can quite easily allow, even without any of the magic of GFMs we discuss below, a highly ⿻, and thus both functional and private, identity landscape."},"655":{"comment":"The key question that then remains is whether the process of such ⿻ social verification would end up undermining the protection of identities. After all, a core part of why we have such a dysfunctional identity landscape is that liberal democratic polities have resisted the creation of identity systems is precisely this fear.

It is about information remaining in the social setting for which it was intended, what leading privacy scholar Helen Nissenbaum calls \"contextual integrity\".[^Nissenbaum] In fact, it requires a certain kind of publicity: if information is not shared and understood by those for whom it is intended this can be as damaging as if information is over-shared.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the dominant paradigm of computing was large \"mainframes\" sold primarily by International Business Machines (IBM).  These were expensive machines intended to serve the needs of an entire business, university department or other large grouping.  To access these machines, users would have to bring programs to a central administrator, and they would, infrequently, have a single \"high risk\" chance to run their desired computation.  If it turned out to have a bug, as it often did, they would have to return later, having meticulously and without practical tests attempted to fix these errors.  At the same time, because preparing programs and managing the machine was so challenging, much of their time was spent idling, waiting for programs to arrive."},"694":{"comment":"Contrast this to today's world of personal computing, where most people in developed countries today have computers on their desks, laps, wrists and in their pockets that perform a dizzying array of computations with near-instant feedback.

But what Lick and some of the early projects he funded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other universities saw was that at least some of this was possible even with the computers of the time if they were used more efficiently and with greater attention to the human need for feedback that he had studied in his work on designing airplane interfaces."},"695":{"comment":"Much of the limited computation power then available was wasted in idle time and the feedback desired by users did not require a full machine at every desk.

The possibilities for data sharing are richer and potentially even more transformative.

In short, rates of waste (effective under- and unemployment) of physical assets even close to these would be considered a global crisis."},"702":{"comment":"The key reason why this silent crisis is a bit less surprising than the figures suggest is that these purely digital assets are comparatively new.

The origins of our contemporary systems of property (rental systems, capital management), labor, and practices that involve the abstract representation of value [^MysteryOfCapital] (with deeds, documents issued to people, supply chain transactions, and money) can be traced to certain social-psychological qualities that arose after 1000 years of cultural practices. The ban on cousin marriages in Christian Europe led to the emergence of people who were free to form new institutions and re-constitute how property was held which created new types of democratic institutions that didn't exist before [^Henrich]. There have been decades to figure out how to efficiently rent cars and increasingly harness digital tools to improve the sharing of these assets (e.g. ride and house-sharing platforms).  Digital assets, especially those in the hands of large groups of non-technical people, date back only a few decades.

This open protocol allows computers around the world to offer storage to each other at a reasonable cost in a peer-to-peer, fragmented, encrypted and distributed manner that helps ensure redundancy, robustness and data secrecy/integrity. Prominent services built on the protocol include the use by Taiwan's [Ministry of Digital Affairs](https://moda.gov.tw/en/press/press-releases/6237) and other governments facing strong adversaries who may hold leverage over more centralized service providers. To ensure the persistence of their data and the storage market PL also created the [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) system to allow commercial transactions and incent users to store as much of the entire network’s data as they can. Yet even IPFS has been a limited success for \"real-time\" storage, where files need to be stored to allow their rapid access from many places around the world.

Furthermore, these computers are physically closer and often more tightly networked to the consumers of computational resources than the bespoke cloud data centers...and yet the \"genius\" of the cloud system has systematically wasted them.  In short, despite its many successes, the cloud has to a large extent involved a reversion to an even more centralized version of the \"mainframe\" model that preceded the time-sharing work Lick helped support, rather than a realization of its ambitions."},"710":{"comment":"Yet even these limited successes have been far more encouraging than what has been achieved in data sharing.  The largest-scale uses of data today are either extremely siloed not just within corporate or institutional boundaries but even highly subdivided by privacy policies within these or otherwise based on the ingestion of publicly available data online without even the awareness, much less consent, of the data creators.  The leading example of the latter is the still-undisclosed data sets on which the GFMs were trained.  The movement to allow data sharing even for clear public interest cases, such as public health or the curing of diseases, has been held out for years under a variety of names and yet has made very little progress either in the private sector or in open standards-based collaborations."},"711":{"comment":"This problem is widely recognized and the subject of a variety of campaigns around the world.

From the fact that data sharing has failed most spectacularly, and storage sharing has struggled most with issues around data sharing, a natural hypothesis is that related issues may lie at the core of many of these problems.  After all, related challenges reoccur in all these domains.  Much of the structure of IPFS and the challenges it faces relate to maintaining data privacy while allowing storage far from the person or organization seeking to maintain this privacy.  A central advantage of the cloud providers has been their reputation for  security and privacy of customer data while allowing those customers to share it across their devices and perform large-scale computations on it."},"713":{"comment":"A basic contrast between data and many real-world assets is important in understanding these challenges.  Lending and pooling of assets is ubiquitous in the economy as we discussed above.  Critical to it is the possibility of decomposing the rights one has to an asset.  Legal scholars typically describe three attributes of property: \"usus\" (the right to use something), \"abusus\" (the right to alter or dispose of it) and \"fructus\" (the right to the value it creates).  A standard rental contract, for example, transfers to the renter the usus rights, while retaining abusus and fructus for the landlord.  A corporation grants usus of many assets to employees, abusus only to senior managers (and often only with checks and balances), and reserves fructus for shareholders."},"714":{"comment":"Achieving this crucial separation is different and arguably more challenging for data.  The simplest ways of giving access to usus of data also allow the person granted access the ability to abuse or transfer the data to others (abusus) and the ability for others to gain financial benefit from those data (fructus), possibly at the expense of the person sharing it.  Many who chose to publish data online that has now been incorporated into GFMs believed they were sharing information for others to use, but they did not perceive the full implications that sharing would have.  Of course, norms, laws and cryptography could all potentially play a role in correcting this situation, and we turn to these shortly. At present these are all underdeveloped relative to expectations in, for example, corporate governance or housing rentals, impairing the ability of data sharing to thrive."},"715":{"comment":"To make matters more complicated, settling on such a set of standards is, for the reasons we highlighted in the [Association and ⿻ Publics chapter](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/), challenged by the other key property of data: that interests in it are rarely if ever usefully understood as mostly individual rights.  Data are inherently associational, social and intersectional, making many of the simplest \"quick fixes\" for this problem (in terms of privacy regulations and cryptography) so misfitting that they impede progress more than they facilitate it."},"716":{"comment":"Furthermore, even if there were a clear set of solutions to these challenges, there is no straightforward way to implement them directly.  The most simplistic understanding of contracts is that they are commitments between parties described and mutually agreed to in a document. The freedom of contract simply requires these be enforced.  The reality is much richer, however: it is impossible to specify in a contract how to resolve many conflicts that may arise and no one could read and process such a detailed document if it were.[^incomplete] Contracts are necessarily both ambiguous on many points and deliberately do not touch many questions (e.g. \"the worker should work really hard\" and \"the employer should be fair\") that are important but hard to precisely specify. Most contractual arrangements are therefore governed primarily by customary expectations, legal precedent, statutes that are consistent with these, mutually expected norms, etc.  In many contexts, contractual provisions that conflict with these evolved principles will not be enforced.  These norms and legal structures have co-evolved over decades and even centuries to govern canonical relationships like rental and employment, minimizing the role that formal court-based contractual provisions and enforcement have to play.  While self-enforcing digital \"smart contracts\" might thus provide a way to implement such norms smoothly, they cannot substitute for the process of creating a stable social understanding of how data collaboration works, what different parties can expect, and when various legal and technical enforcement mechanisms should and will kick in."},"717":{"comment":"[^incomplete]: Sanford J.

Hart, \"The Costs and Benefits of Ownership: A Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration\", *Journal of Political Economy* 94, no. 4: 691-719."},"718":{"comment":"Challenges of this sort surround efforts to build infrastructure for sharing digital assets like data. The basic problem is that information has a near-infinity of possible uses, meaning that heavily \"contractualist\" approaches that seek to define exactly how parties may use information run into unmanageable complexity. Such contracts' zones of \"incompleteness\" are overwhelmingly vast because it is not possible even to imagine, let alone catalog and negotiate over all the possible future uses of information like genetics or geolocation. That means that the most promising possible benefits of data sharing -- which involve taking advantage of new technical affordance to convey information to distant parties all around the world -- are also the most dangerous and ungovernable. The potential market is therefore paralyzed. If we cannot address these problems with conventional contracts, our ideal spheres of information sharing will end up matching the shape of our associations -- meaning we need better maps of our associative connections, and, as discussed elsewhere, better assurances against information leakage even from trusted communities."},"719":{"comment":"Of course, these are far from the only problems besetting digital asset sharing: optimizing for latency, mapping security measures, appropriately standardizing units of compute and other such technical obstacles are also significant. But the challenges created by the lack of clear and meaningful standards (both legal and technical) for protecting data while it is shared spill out into almost every aspect of scalable digital cooperation.  While no deductive analysis can substitute for the social experimentation and evolution that will be needed to reach such standards, we can highlight some of the components and efforts that seem likely to address the central tensions above and thus should become important to social exploration if we are going to get past the current barriers to digital asset sharing."},"720":{"comment":"The first and simplest issue to address is standards for performance and security for computational asset sharing.  When users store their data or entrust a computation to others, they need assurances that their data will not be compromised by a third party and that the computation will be performed according to their expectations, that their data will be retrievable by themselves or their customers with an expected distribution of latency by people in various places etc.  Currently, these sorts of guarantees are central to the value propositions of the cloud providers. Because there are no standards that can easily be met by a broad set of individuals and organizations offering computational services, these powerful companies dominate the market.  An analogous example is the introduction of Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), which allowed a range of web hosting services to meet security criteria that give web content consumers confidence that they can access data from that website without being maliciously surveilled.  Such standards could naturally be paired with standardized formats for searching, requesting, and matching on additional performance and security features."},"721":{"comment":"However, as noted above, the thorniest questions pertain not to performance or third-party attacks, but to the problems at the heart of data collaboration: what should a collaborator Party B with whom Party A shares data or other digital assets learn about Party A's data?  While this obviously has no single right answer, setting parameters and expectations in ways that allow participants to benefit from collaboration without frequently undermining their critical interests or those of other people affected by this collaboration is central to making data collaboration feasible and sustainable.  Luckily, a number of tools are becoming available that will help provide technical scaffolding for such relationships."},"722":{"comment":"While we have discussed it in the [Association](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/?mode=dark) chapter, it is worth recalling their relevance here. Secure multiparty computation (SMPC) and homomorphic encryption allow multiple parties to perform a computation together and create a collective output without each revealing to the others the inputs.  While the simplest illustrative examples include calculating an average salary or tallying votes in an election, far more sophisticated possibilities are increasingly within reach, such as training or fine-tuning a GFM.  These more ambitious applications have helped create the field of \"federated learning\" and \"data federation\", which allow the computations necessary for one of these ambitious applications to be performed locally on a distributed network of personal or organizational computers with the inputs to the model being passed back and forth securely without the underlying training data ever leaving the machine or servers of the respective parties to the communication.  In collaboration with open-source providers of these tools such as [OpenMined](https://openmined.org/), international organizations like the United Nations have increasingly built experimental showcase platforms for data collaboration harnessing these tools.[^OM] An alternative to this distributed approach is to use specialized \"confidential computers\" that can be verified to perform particular calculations but give no one access to their intermediate outputs.  Because these machines are expensive and produced by only a limited range of companies, however, these lend themselves more to control by a trusted central entity than diffuse collaboration."},"723":{"comment":"[^OM]: \"The UN is Testing Technology that Processes Data Confidentially\" *The Economist* January 29, 2022."},"724":{"comment":"While these approaches can help achieve a collaboration without unnecessary information being conveyed across collaborators, other tools are needed to address the information contained in the desired outputs (e.g. statistics or models) created by the collaboration.  Models may both leak input information (e.g. a model reproduces intimate details of the medical history of a particular person) or may, conversely, obscure the source of information (e.g. reproduce input creative text without attribution, in violation of a license).  Both are significant impediments to data collaboration, as collaborators will typically want agency over the use of their data."},"725":{"comment":"Tools to address these challenges are more statistical than cryptographic.

Given the pace of technological change and adaptation in what data collaborations will thus become, these norms will both have to become pervasive and reasonably stable *and* dynamic and adaptive.  Achieving this will require practices of education and cultural engagement that keep pace with technical change, as we discuss in the following chapters."},"734":{"comment":"Once they develop and spread sufficiently, data collaboration tools, organizations and practices may become sufficiently familiar to be encoded in common sense and legal practice as deeply as \"property rights\" are, though as we noted they will almost certainly have to take a different form than the standard patterns governing private ownership of land or the organization of a joint-stock corporation.  They will, as we noted, need to include many more technical and cryptographic elements, different kinds of social organizations with a greater emphasis on collective governance and fiduciary duties and norms or laws protecting against unilateral disclosure by a member of a MIDs (analogous to prohibitions against unilateral strikebreaking against unions).

In some ways, the deeply social character of data sets it apart from real-world assets, and therefore our existing modes of designing property rights and contractual systems are not readily applied to data. But in other ways, the deeply social character of data accentuates, through its unfamiliarity, many of the ways traditional property systems are themselves ill-suited to managing real assets today."},"736":{"comment":"We take one step away from the purely digital asset world and look to two examples of digitally-related assets whose property rights regimes are changing rapidly.

These assumptions have been tested to the breaking point recently, however, as many digital applications (such as WiFi) can share spectrum and the rapidly changing nature of uses for spectrum (e.g. moving from over-the-air broadcasting to 5G wireless) has dramatically changed interference patterns, requiring a reorganization of the spectrum against which legacy license holders can often serve as holdouts.[^Milgrom] This, in turn, has led to significant changes to the property system, allowing licensing agencies like America's Federal Communications Commission to relocate holdouts in auctions, and proposals by leaders in the space for even more radical designs that would mix elements of rental and ownership as we discuss in our [Social Markets](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-7/eng/?mode=dark) chapter below or leave spectrum unlicensed for specified shared uses.[^licenses]"},"738":{"comment":"[^Milgrom]:  Paul R.

These engines usually list sites associated with a given name based on a variety of (mostly not publicly disclosed) signals of their relevance to users as well as including some paid advertisements that are auctioned in real-time.[^Edelman]  While relevance algorithms are something of a black box, a reasonable first mental model for them is the original \"[PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank)\" algorithm of Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, which ranked pages based on their \"network centrality\", a notion related to the network-based voting systems we will discuss in our chapter on [⿻ Voting](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-6/eng/?mode=dark) below.

Norbert Wiener coined the term \"cybernetics\" for a field studying such rich interactive systems.

Most non-governmental collective ownership takes the form of a standard joint stock company governed by the principle of one-share-one-vote and the maximization of shareholder value.  While there are significant restrictions on the rights of private property owners based on community interests, these overwhelmingly take the form of regulations by a small number of governmental levels, such as national, provincial/state and local/city. These practices are in sharp contrast to the property regimes that have prevailed in most human societies throughout most of history, in which individual ownership was rarely absolutely institutionalized and a diversity of \"traditional\" expectations governed how possessions can rightly be used and exchanged. Such traditional structures were largely erased by modernity and colonialism as they attempted to pattern property into a marketable \"commodity\", allowing exchange and reuse for a much broad set of purposes than was possible within full social context.[^Polanyi]"},"778":{"comment":"Prior to modernity, individuals were born into families rooted within kin-based institutions that provided everything, livelihood, sustenance, meaning, and that were for the most part inescapable. No \"official documents\" were needed or useful as people rarely traveled beyond the boundaries of those they knew well.

Paper-based markers of affiliations with such institutions began to supplant informal kin knowledge.

While other critical credentials, such as  educational attainment are more diverse, they almost uniformly conform to a limited structure, implying one of a small number of \"degrees\" derived from courses with a particular \"Carnegie unit\" structure (in theory, 120 hours spent with an instructor), in contrast to the broad range of potential recognition that could be given to learning attainment as illustrated in Figure A.

Some countries also have consociational structures in which designated social groups (e.g. religions or political parties) agree to share power in some specified fashion, ensuring that even if one group's vote share declines they retain something of their historical power.

In this sense, his work is more a helpful invitation to step beyond the easy answers private property offers, which is perhaps why his enormously influential ideas have only been partly implemented in a small number of (admittedly highly successful) places like Estonia and Taiwan."},"803":{"comment":"The world George invites us to reflect on and imagine how to design for is thus one of ⿻ value, one where a variety of entities, localized at different scales (universities, municipalities, nation states, etc.) all contribute to differing degrees to create value, just as networks of waves and neurons contribute to differing degrees to the probabilities of particles being found in various positions or thoughts occurring in a mind.

Georg Simmel, pictured in Figure B, was a German philosopher and sociologist of the turn of the twentieth century who pioneered the idea of social networks. The mistranslation of his work as focused on a “web” eventually went “worldwide”.  In his 1955 translation of Simmel’s classic 1908 Soziologie, Reinhard Bendix chose to describe Simmel’s idea as describing a “web of group-affiliations” over what he described as the “almost meaningless” direct translation “intersection of social circles”.[^Soziologie] While the precise lines of influence are hard to trace, it is possible that, had Bendix made an opposite choice, we might talk of the internet in terms of \"intersecting global circles\" rather than the \"world wide web\".[^InfluenceOfSimmel]"},"806":{"comment":"Simmel’s “intersectional” theory of identity offered an alternative to both the traditional individualist/atomist (characteristic at the time in sociology with the work of Max Weber and deeply influential on Libertarianism) and collectivist/structuralist (characteristic at the time of the sociology of Émile Durkheim and deeply influential on Technocracy) accounts.  From a Simmelian point of view, both appear as extreme reductions/projections of a richer underlying theory."},"807":{"comment":"In his view, humans are deeply social creatures and thus their identities are deeply formed through their social relations.  Humans gain crucial aspects of their sense of self, their goals, and their meaning through participation in social, linguistic, and solidaristic groups.  In simple societies (e.g., isolated, rural, or tribal), people spend most of their life interacting with the kin groups we described above.  This circle comes to (primarily) define their identity collectively, which is why most scholars of simple societies (for example, anthropologist Marshall Sahlins) tend to favor methodological collectivism.[^Sahlins] However, as we noted above, as societies urbanize social relationships diversify.  People work with one circle, worship with another, support political causes with a third, recreate with a fourth, cheer for a sports team with a fifth, identify as discriminated against along with a sixth, and so on.  These diverse affiliations together form a person’s identity.  The more numerous and diverse these affiliations become, the less likely it is that anyone else shares precisely the same intersection of affiliations."},"808":{"comment":"As this occurs, people come to have, on average, less of their full sense of self in common with those around them at any time; they begin to feel “unique” (to put a positive spin on it) and “isolated/misunderstood” (to put a negative spin on it).  This creates a sense of what he called “qualitaitive individuality” that helps explain why social scientists focused on complex urban settings (such as economists) tend to favor methodological individualism.  However, ironically as Simmel points out, such “individuation” occurs precisely because and to the extent that the “individual” becomes divided among many loyalties and thus dividual.  Thus, while methodological individualism (and what he called the \"egalitarian individualism\" of nation states we highlighted above that it justfied) takes the “(in)dividual” as the irreducible element of social analysis, Simmel instead suggests that individuals become possible as an emergent property of the complexity and dynamism of modern, urban societies."},"809":{"comment":"Thus the individual that the national identity systems seek to strip away from the shackles of communities actually emerges from their growth, proliferation and intersection.  As a truly just and efficient property regime would recognize and account for such networked interdependence, identity systems that truly empower and support modern life would need to mirror its ⿻  structure."},"810":{"comment":"If (in)dividual identity is so fluid and dynamic, surely so too must be the social circles that intersect to constitute it.  As Simmel highlights, new social groups are constantly forming, while older ones decline. Three examples he highlights are for his time, the still-recent formations of cross-sectoral 'working men’s associations' representing the general interest of labor, the emerging feminist associations, and the cross-sectoral employers' interest groups. The critical pathway to creating such new circles was the establishment of places (e.g. workman’s halls) or publications (e.g. working men’s newspapers) where this new group could come to know one another and understand, and thus to have things in common they do not have with others in the broader society. Such bonds were strengthened by secrecy, as shared secrets allowed for a distinctive identity and culture, as well as the coordination in a common interest in ways unrecognizable by outsiders.[^SecretSocieties]   Developing these shared, but hidden, knowledge allows the emerging social circle to act as a collective agent."},"811":{"comment":"In his 1927 work that defined his political philosophy, *The Public and its Problems*, John Dewey (who we meet in [A View from Yushan](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/2-1/eng/?mode=dark)) considered the political implications and dynamics of these “emergent publics” as he called them.[^PublicProblems]Dewey's views emerged from a series of debates he held, as leader of the \"democratic\" wing of the progressive movement after his return from China with left-wing technocrat  Walter Lippmann, whose 1922 book *Public Opinion* Dewey considered \"the most effective indictment of democracy as currently conceived\".[^Westbrook]  In the debate, Dewey sought to redeem democracy while embracing fully Lippmann's critique of existing institutions as ill-suited to an increasingly complex and dynamic wold."},"812":{"comment":"[^Westbrook]: Robert Westbrook, *John Dewey and American Democracy* (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press)."},"813":{"comment":"While he acknowledged a range of forces for social dynamism, Dewey focused specifically on the role of technology in creating new forms of interdependence that created the necessity for new publics.  Railroads connected people commercially and socially who would never have met.  Radio created shared political understanding and action across thousands of miles.  Pollution from industry was affecting rivers and urban air.  All these technologies resulted from research, the benefits of which spread with little regards for local and national boundaries.  The social challenges (e.g. governance railway tariffs, safety standards, and disease propagation; fairness in access to scarce radio) arising from these forms of interdependence are poorly managed by both capitalist markets and preexisting “democratic” governance structures."},"814":{"comment":"Markets fail because these technologies create market power, pervasive externalities (such as \"network externalities\"), and more generally exhibit “[supermodularity](https://cip.org/supermodular)” (sometimes called “increasing returns”), where the whole of the (e.g. railroad network) is greater than the sum of its parts; see our chapter on [Social Markets](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-7/eng/?mode=dark).    Capitalist enterprises cannot account for all the relevant “spillovers” and to the extent they do, they accumulate market power, raise prices and exclude participants, undermining the value created by increasing returns. Leaving these interdependencies “to the market” thus exacerbates their risks and harms while failing to leverage their potential."},"815":{"comment":"Dewey revered democracy as the most fundamental principle of his career; barely a paragraph can pass without him harkening back to it.  He firmly believed that democratic action could address the failings of markets.  Yet he saw the limits of existing “democratic” institutions just as severely as those of capitalism.  The problem is that existing democratic institutions are not, in Dewey’s view, truly democratic with regards to the emergent challenges created by technology."},"816":{"comment":"In particular, what it means to say an institution is “democratic” is not just that it involves participation and voting.  Many oligarchies had these forms, but did not include most citizens and thus were not democratic.  Nor would, in Dewey’s mind, a global “democracy” directly managing the affairs of a village count as democratic.  Core to true democracy is the idea that the “relevant public”, the set of people whose lives are actually shaped by the phenomenon in question, manage that challenge.  Because technology is constantly throwing up new forms of interdependence, which will almost never correspond precisely to existing political boundaries, true democracy requires new publics to constantly emerge and reshape existing jurisdictions."},"817":{"comment":"Furthermore, because new forms of interdependence are not easily perceived by most individuals in their everyday lives, Dewey saw a critical role for what he termed “social science experts” but we might with no more abuse of terminology call “entrepreneurs”, “leaders”, “founders”, “pioneer” or, as we prefer, “mirror”.  Just as George Washington's leadership helped the US both perceive itself as a nation and a nation that had to democratically choose its fate after his term in office, the role of such mirrors is to perceive a new form of interdependence (e.g. solidarity among workers, the carbon-to-global-warming chain), explain it to those involved by both word and deed, and thereby empower a new public to come into existence. Historical examples are union leaders, founders of rural electricity cooperatives, and the leaders who founded the United Nations.  Once this emergent public is understood, recognized, and empowered to govern the new interdependence, the role of the mirror fades away, just as Washington returned to Mount Vernon."},"818":{"comment":"Thus, as the mirror image of Simmel’s philosophy of (in)dividual identity, Dewey’s conception of democracy and emergent publics is at once profoundly democratic and yet challenges and even overturns our usual conception of democracy.  Democracy, in this conception, is not the static system of representation of a nation-state with fixed borders.  It is a process even more dynamic than a market, led by a diverse range of entrepreneurial mirrors, who draw upon the ways they are themselves intersections of unresolved social tensions to renew and re-imagine social institutions.  Standard institutions of nation state-based voting are to such a process as pale a shadow as Newtonian mechanics is of the underlying quantum and relativistic reality. True democracy must be ⿻ and constantly evolving."},"819":{"comment":"All of these critiques and directions of thought are suggestive, but none seems to offer clear paths to action and further scientific development.  Could the understanding of the ⿻nature of social organization be turned into a scientific engine of new forms of social organization?  This hypothesis was the seed from which Norbert Wiener sprouted the modern field of \"cybernetics\", from which comes all the uses of \"cyber\" to describe digital technology and, many would argue, the later name of \"computer science\" given to similar work.  Wiener defined cybernetics as \"the science of control and communication in (complex systems like) the animal and machine\", but perhaps the most broadly accepted meaning is something like the \"science of communication within and governance of, by and for networks\".[^Cybernetics] The word was drawn from a Greek analogy of a ship directed by the inputs of its many oarsmen."},"820":{"comment":"Wiener's scientific work focused almost exclusively on physical, biological and information systems, investigating the ways that organs and machines can obtain and preserve homeostasis, quantifying information transmission channels and the role they play in achieving such equilibrium and so on.  Personally and politically, he was a pacifist, severe critic of capitalism as failing basic principles of cybernetic stabilization and creation of homeostasis and advocate of radically more responsible use and deployment of technology.[^HumanUse]  He despaired that without profound social reform his scientific work would come to worse than nothing, writing in the introduction to *Cybernetics*, \"there are those who hope that the good of a better understanding of man and society which is offered by this new field of work may anticipate and outweigh the incidental contribution we are making to the concentration of power (which is always concentrated, by its very conditions of existence, in the hand of the most unscrupulous.  I write in 1947, and I am compelled to say that it is a very slight hope.\"  It is thus unsurprising that Wiener befriended many social scientists and reformers who vested \"considerable...hopes...for the social efficacy of whatever new ways of thinking this book may contain.\""},"821":{"comment":"Yet while he shared the convictions, he believed these hopes to be mostly \"false\".  While he judged such a program as \"necessary\", he was unable to \"believe it possible\".  He argued that quantum physics had shown the impossibility of precision at the level of particles and therefore that the success of science arose from the fact that we live far above the level of particles, but that our very existence within societies meant that the same principles made social science essentially inherently infeasible.  Thus as much as he hoped to offer scientific foundations on which the work of George, Simmel and Dewey could rest, he was skeptical of \"exaggerated expectations of their possibilities.\""},"822":{"comment":"Across all of these authors, we see many common threads. We see appreciation of the ⿻ and layered nature of society, which often shows even greater complexity than other phenomena in the natural sciences: while an electron typically orbits a single atom or molecule, a cell is part of one organism, and a planet orbits one star, in human society each person, and even each organization, is part of multiple intersecting larger entities, often with no single of them being fully inside any other. But how might these advancements in the social sciences translate into similarly more advanced social technologies?

The future of journalism empowering us to know things that are profoundly different is therefore bright."},"833":{"comment":"One of the most important trends in the production of journalism in the internet era has been the rise of so-called \"citizen journalism\" and the allied \"open-source intelligence\" movement, both of which aim to empower a much broader diversity of people than those traditionally employed as formal journalists or intelligence analysts to document important events in the world around them. Such journalism has been central to documenting many of the most important events in recent years, from terrorist attacks to wars and police abuse.  Yet it also faces significant criticism and social concern over bias, rigor of verification of facts, and legibility and digestibility."},"834":{"comment":"It is easy to see how many recent technological developments could dramatically exacerbate these problems. Generative foundation models (GFMs) will make the production of realistic fakes far easier and will spread distrust of any material without rigorous, multi-source validation.  The echo chambers of anti-social media will allow fakes to spread even absent such vetting, proliferating misleading content and the conditions under which people will believe it."},"835":{"comment":"Yet there are equally clear precedents for how technology could offset these challenges.  Wikipedia has shown the speed and scale at which distributed participation can produce roughly and broadly consensual accounts of many events, though not quite yet at the speed required of journalism.  Many of the tools we have described above and detail below can help address challenges of rigorous verification at distance and scale and rapid achievement of rough and socially contextual consensus that is a more appropriate frame for thinking about \"objectivity\"."},"836":{"comment":"Perhaps one of the most interesting possibilities, though, is the way in which GFMs may allow for a new form of coherent, digestible, broadly traveling and yet authentic community voice.  There is a long-standing tension in journalism between allowing a community to \"speak for itself\" (often through quotes or extended descriptions of community practices) and crafting a compelling narrative digestible to the target audience, and an even greater one that arises when articles are translated for other audiences.  GFMs will increasingly allow communities to finesse these trade-offs, as they can learn from and synthesize the speech patterns of community members, incorporate verified facts, and at the same time smoothly translate to a range of languages and subcultural standards and styles.  This will empower groups of citizens who are not trained as journalists to convey the important stories they have to tell with precision and clarity to diverse publics."},"837":{"comment":"One of the most frequently dramatized tensions in journalism surrounds the role of source confidentiality. Confidentiality to the subject of the report is often broken by a confidential source to create the credibility of reports.  Journalists have to verify the authenticity of their sources and the information they provide, while ensuring their secrecy from (among others) the organizations they inform on and the credibility of their report to the public. In many cases, confidential informants are sharing information that the norms of their organization prohibit them from sharing.  This creates strong tensions between many of the values we have highlighted above: protecting the associations, ensuring the integrity of the public sphere, etc.  How might the tools of ⿻ help navigate these challenging waters?"},"838":{"comment":"Many parts of the above process are naturally facilitated by the tools we highlight in the [\"Identity and Personhood\"](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-1/eng/) and [\"Association and ⿻ Publics\"](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/) chapters.  Most of the tools for protecting ⿻ publics could be applied by organizations to reduce the credibility of documents shared outside their intended social context.  At the same time, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) based on public credentials could allow sources to remain confidential even to journalists while proving (elements of) their position to journalists' audiences.  Yet, absent some reconciliation, such strategies could quickly become an \"arms race\", escalating cryptography without arriving at a better social outcome."},"839":{"comment":"A potential resolution of this impasse arises from the subtle distinctions these protocols make regarding verification.  If someone publicly holds a position in an organization, they will typically be able to prove this to others using a ZKP without revealing other elements of their identity.  They may then be able to harness the associated reputation, but no more, to make claims about things occurring in the organization.  But for more sensitive information and expansive claims, especially if the person only holds a relatively low position in the organization, additional verification will usually be required to make this credible.  One way is by revealing more (public) information about themselves, but this will narrow the pool of people they could be and thus expose them.  Another is to provide direct verification (\"receipts\") of the claims.  However, if these receipts are protected by technologies like designated verifier signatures, this is only possible by exposing their \"private key\" to another person (e.g. the journalist or legal authority), which puts them at risk of exploitation or exposure by that other person unless she is herself highly trustworthy."},"840":{"comment":"Of course, the precise details vary greatly depending on which precise tools are used by each participant in this dance.  But overall, it illustrates how ⿻ cryptography can simultaneously allow for a quite intricate mix of trustworthy and private disclosures, protection of community norms of confidentiality and the ability to override these norms at personal cost in a broader social interest when critical."},"841":{"comment":"While many Americans look back with nostalgia on the history of the press, the era of \"press responsibility\" against which they judge the harms of anti-social media, dates only to the 1940s. This was when the \"[Hutchins Commission on Freedom of the Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutchins_Commission)\" developed a code of social responsibility under which the press would act as the \"common carriers of public discussion\", creating a baseline of shared understanding on which public debate could proceed.[^Hutchins]  That commission argued that a central role of a free press in a democratic society is to clarify to all citizens both the points of consensus (viz. the \"Walter Cronkite effect\" of commonly watched, consensual news) and fact and those of divergence (viz. the \"[fairness doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_doctrine)\" and practice of balancing diverging perspectives) to allow self-government to thrive.

For each such community, the algorithms could highlight \"common content\" (commonly agreed facts and values) of the group that spans the divides internally, as well as important points of division within the community.  Content could then be highlighted to members of the communities within this social context, making clear which content is rough consensus in the communities that a citizen is a member of and which content is divisive, as well as offering opportunities for the citizen to explore content that is consensus on the other side of each divide from the one she is on within that community."},"844":{"comment":"Such a design would continue to offer individuals and communities the agency social media affords them to respectively shape their own intersectional identities and self-govern.  Yet at the same time, it would avoid the rampant \"false consensus\" effect where netizens come to believe that extreme or idiosyncratic views are widely shared, fueling demonization of those who do not share them and a feeling of resentment when associated political outcomes are not achieved or \"pluralistic ignorance\" where netizens are unable to act collectively on \"silent majority\" views.[^Note] Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, it would reshape the incentives of journalists and other creators away from divisive content and towards stories that bring us together.  It is relevant beyond \"hard journalism\" *per se* as many other cultural forms (e.g. music) benefit from audiences who want to share cultural objects and fandom with others."},"845":{"comment":"The recommendations of the Hutchins Commission were largely adopted by leading media outlets as part of the then-prominent campaign for \"social responsibility\", which has recently made a comeback in the form of commitments to \"environmental, social and governance\" (ESG) goals among many companies.

One of the largest and most profitable business models, pursued by corporations like Microsoft and Slack, is selling productivity software, which often includes social media-like components, to companies to boost productivity.  These companies have no interest in \"engaged\" or polarized employees; the goal of the tools is to bring employees together to accomplish shared goals and adjust to change.  A new, pro-social media model could thus naturally be incubated in such settings and then sold, in broader social contexts, to other organizations interested in solidarity and dynamism."},"848":{"comment":"Furthermore, there are good reasons to believe such organizations could afford to displace advertising revenue.  Most democratic governments (e.g. Germany, Finland, United States) spend more than a billion dollars a year supporting public media and far more than that subsidizing other culture.[^Publicmedia] Even religious media received more than $100 million in the United States alone in 2022.[^Religiousmedia]  This compares to roughly $5 billion in advertising revenue earned by Twitter (now X) in 2022, at its peak.[^Twitterrev]  It thus seems quite plausible that, together, a range of community representative organizations could replace advertising as a revenue stream, if community leaders focused on this space and social media channeled its attention to this new business model."},"849":{"comment":"This might play out in a variety of ways, but a simple one would be for participants to opt into a set of communities they identify with.  Each would \"sponsor\" their community members' use in exchange for the prioritization of their members' attention to the community-relevant content we discussed above.  Users who did not sign up for communities paying sufficiently might have to accept some amount of advertising or pay a subscription fee, and the service could identify from its own patterns communities and approach their leaders to ask for payment.

This sensitivity allows the brain to adapt and learn from experience. **Chaos**: Chaos is a property of complex systems that exhibit unpredictable behavior even though they are deterministic. In neuroscience, chaos has been observed in the activity of neurons in the brain.

This chaotic activity may play a role in information processing and communication within the brain. **Sensitivity and chaos together:** Sensitivity and chaos can also interact in the brain to produce complex and adaptive behavior. For example, studies have shown that the brain can exhibit sensitivity to small changes in sensory input, but this sensitivity can also lead to chaotic activity in neural networks. However, this chaotic activity can be controlled and harnessed to produce adaptive behavior, such as in the case of motor control and coordination.

While each of these initiatives has strengths and weaknesses, the idea that a public mission aimed at creating infrastructure that empowers decentralized innovation in collaboration with civil society and participation but not dominance from the private sector is increasingly a pattern, often labeled \"digital public infrastructure\" (DPI).  To a large extent, we are primarily advocating for this approach to be scaled up and become the central approach to the development of global ⿻ society.

While it was a multisectoral effort, ARPA was centered around the American military-industrial complex and its collaborators in the American academy.  This made sense in the context of the 1960s, where the US was one of two major world powers, scientific funding and mission was deeply tied to its stand-off with the Soviet Union and most digital technology was being developed in the academy.  As Lick observed, however, even by the late 1970s this was already becoming a poor fit. Today's world is (as discussed above) much more multi-polar even in its development of leading DPI. The primary civil technology developers are in the open source community, private companies dominate much of the digital world and military applications are only one aspect of the public's vision for digital technology, which increasingly shapes every aspect of contemporary life.  To adapt, a vision of ⿻ infrastructure for today must engage the public in setting the mission of technology through institutions like digital ministries, network transnationally and harness open source technology, as well as redirecting the private sector, more effectively."},"994":{"comment":"Lick and the ARPANET collaborators shaped an extraordinary vision that laid the groundwork for the internet and ⿻.  Yet Lick saw that this could not ground the legitimacy of his project for long; as we highlighted central to his aspirations was that \"decisions about the development and exploitation of computer technology must be made not only 'in the public interest' but in the interest of giving the public itself the means to enter into the decision-making processes that will shape their future.\" Military technocracy cannot be the primary locus for setting the agenda if ⿻ is to achieve the legitimacy and public support necessary to make the requisite investments to center ⿻ infrastructure.  Instead we will need to harness the full suite of ⿻ technologies we have discussed above to engage transnational publics in reaching an overlapping consensus on a mission that can motivate a similarly concerted effort to IPTO's.  These tools include ⿻ competence education to make every citizen feel empowered to shape the ⿻ future, cultural institutions like Japan's [Miraikan](https://www.miraikan.jst.go.jp/en/) that actively invite citizens into long-term technology planning, ideathons where citizens collaborate on future envisioning and are supported by governments and charities to build these visions into media that can be more broadly consumed, [alignment assemblies](https://cip.org/alignmentassemblies) and other augmented deliberations on the direction of technology and more."},"995":{"comment":"Digital (hopefully soon, ⿻) ministries, emerging worldwide, are proving to be a more natural forum for setting visionary goals in a participatory way, surpassing traditional military hosts.

As digital challenges become central to global security, more nations are likely to appoint digital ministers, fostering an open, connected digital community."},"998":{"comment":"Yet national homes for ⿻ infrastructure constitute only a few of the poles holding up its tent.  There is no country today that can or should alone be the primary locus for such efforts.  They must be built as at least international and probably transnational networks, just as the internet is.  Digital ministers, as their positions are created, must themselves form a network that can provide international support to this work and connect nation-based nodes just as ARPANET did for university-based nodes.  Many of the open source projects participating will not themselves have a single primary national presence, spanning many jurisdictions and participating as a transnational community, to be respected on terms that will in some cases be roughly equal to those of national digital ministries. Consider, for example, the relationship of rough equality between the Ethereum community and the Taiwanese Ministry of Digital Affairs."},"999":{"comment":"Exclusively high-level government-to-government relationships are severely limited by the broader state of current international relations.  Many of the countries where the internet has flourished have had at-times troubled relationships with other countries where it has flourished.  Many civil actors have stronger transnational relationships than their governments would agree to supporting at an intergovernmental level, mirroring consistent historical patterns where civil connections through, for example, religion and advocacy of human rights have created a stronger foundation for cooperation than international relations alone. Technology, for better or worse, often crosses borders and boundaries of ideology more easily than treaties can be negotiated.  For example, web3 communities and civic technology organizations like g0v and RadicalxChange have significant presences even in countries that are not widely understood as \"democratic\" in their national politics.  Similar patterns at larger scales have been central to the transnational environmental, human rights, religious and other movements.[^Wendt]"},"1000":{"comment":"While there is no necessary path from such interactions to broader democratization, it would also be an important mistake to miss the opportunity to expand the scope of interoperation in areas where it is possible while waiting for full government-to-government alignment. In her book *A New World Order*, leading international relations scholar Anne-Marie Slaughter sketched how such transnational policy and civil networks will increasingly complement and collaborate with governments around the world and form a fabric of transnational collaboration.[^Slaughter] This fabric or network could be effective than current international bodies like the United Nations.

Yet the element of the digital ecosystem most neglected by governments today is not academia, which still receives billions of dollars of research support.  Instead it is the largely ignored world of open source and other non-profit, mission-driven technology developers.  As we have extensively discussed, these already provide the backbone of much of the global technology stack. Yet they receive virtually no measurable financial support from governments and very little from charities, despite their work belonging (mostly) fully to the public domain and their being developed mostly in the public interest."},"1004":{"comment":"Furthermore, this sector is in many ways better-suited to the development of infrastructure than academic research, much as public infrastructure in the physical world is generally not built by academia.  Academic research is heavily constrained by disciplinary foci and boundaries that civil infrastructure that is broadly usable is unlikely to respect.  Academic careers depend on citation, credit and novelty in a way that is unlikely to align with the best aspirations for infrastructure, which often can and should be invisible, \"boring\" and as easily interoperable with (rather than \"novel\" in contrast to) other infrastructure as possible.  Academic research often focuses on a degree and disciplinary style of rigor and persuasiveness that differs in kind from the ideal  user experience.  While public support for academic research is crucial and in some areas academic projects can contribute to ⿻ infrastructure, governments and charities should not primarily look to the academic research sector.  And while academic research receives hundreds of billions of dollars in funding globally annually, open source communities have likely received less than two billion dollars in their entire history, accounting for known sources as we illustrate in Figure B.

Other organizations may develop non-profit ⿻ infrastructure but wish to charge for elements of it (just as some highways have tolls to address congestion and maintenance) while others may have no proprietary claim but wish to ensure sensitive and private data are not just made publicly available.

Luckily a variety of ⿻ technologies are available to policymakers to foster such an ecosystem."},"1011":{"comment":"Furthermore, whatever the ideal structures, it is unlikely that such public interest institutions will simply substitute for the large, private digital infrastructure built up over the last decades.  Many social networks, cloud infrastructures, single-sign-on architectures, and so forth would be wasteful to simply scrap.  Instead it likely makes sense to harness these investments towards the public interest by pairing public investment with agreements to shift governance to respect public input in much the way we discussed in our chapters on Voting, Media and Workplace.  This closely resembles the way that a previous wave of economic democracy reform with which Dewey was closely associated did not simple out-compete privately created power generation, but instead sought to bring them under a network of partially local democratic control through utility boards.  Many leaders in the tech world refer to their platforms as \"utilities\", \"infrastructure\" or \"public squares\"; it stands to reason that part of a program of ⿻ digital infrastructure will be reforming them so they truly act as such."},"1012":{"comment":"Fostering a ⿻ ecosystem of organizations that serve ⿻ publics including but not limited to open source models will be critical to moving beyond the limits of the academic ARPA model.

Governments, being the largest actor in most national economies, can shape the behavior of the entire digital ecosystem based on what standards they adopt, what entities they purchase from and the way they structure citizens' interactions with public services.  This is the core, for example, of how the India Stack became so central to the private sector, which followed the lead of the public sector and thus the civil projects they supported."},"1015":{"comment":"Yet laws are also at the center of defining what types of structures can exist, what privileges they have and how rights are divided between different entities.  Open source organizations now struggle as they aim to maintain simultaneously their non-profit orientation and an international presence.  Organizations like the [Open Collective Foundation](https://opencollective.com/foundation) were created almost exclusively for the purpose of allowing them to do so and helped support this project, but despite taking a substantial cut of project revenues [was unable to sustain itself](https://blog.opencollective.com/open-collective-official-statement-ocf-dissolution/) and thus is in the process of dissolving as of this writing. The competitive disadvantage of Third-Sector technology providers could hardly be starker.[^OCFdiss] Many other forms of innovative, democratic, transnational organization, like Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) constantly run into legal barriers that only a few jurisdictions like the [State of Wyoming](https://www.wyoleg.gov/2024/Introduced/SF0050.pdf) have just begun to address.  While some of the reasons for these are legitimate (to avoid financial scams, etc.), much more work is needed to establish legal frameworks that support and defend transnational democratic non-profit organizational forms."},"1017":{"comment":"Other organizational forms likely need even further support.  Data coalitions that aim to collectively protect the data rights of creators or those with relevantly collective data interests, as we discussed in our [Property and Contract](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-4/eng/?mode=dark) chapter, will need protection similar to unions and other collective bargaining organizations that they not only do not have at present but which many jurisdictions (like the EU) may effectively prevent them from having, given their extreme emphasis on individual rights in data.  Just as labor law evolved to empower collective bargaining for workers, law will have to evolve to allow data workers to collectively exercise their rights in order to avoid either their being disadvantaged relative to concentrated model builders or so disparate as to offer insuperable barriers to ambitious data collaboration."},"1018":{"comment":"Beyond organizational forms, legal and regulatory changes will be critical to empowering a fair and productive use of data for shared goals.

New standards need to be developed by judges, legislators and regulators in close collaboration with technologists and publics that account for the complex and partial way in which a variety of data informs the output of models and ensures that the associated value is \"back-propagated\" to the data creators just as it is to the intermediate data created within the models in the process of training them.[^Holland]  New rules like these will build on the reforms to property rights that empowered the re-purposing of radio spectrum and should be developed for a variety of other digital assets as we discussed in our [Property and Contract](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-4/eng/?mode=dark) chapter."},"1019":{"comment":"[^Holland]: An interesting line of research suggesting possibility here is that of neural network and genetic algorithm pioneer John H.

Giving direct control over a firm to these counterparties is a natural way to achieve this objective without the usual downsides in competition policy of inhibiting scaled collaboration.  ⿻ technologies offer natural means to instantiate meaningful voice for these stakeholders as we discussed in the [Workplace](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/6-1/eng/?mode=dark) chapter.

While directly charging for services largely reverts to the traps of the private sector, relying primarily on \"general revenue\" is unlikely to be sustainable or legitimate.

While the role of insurance in \"saving for a rainy day\" is clear to most, the value of \"pooling\" risk across individuals is subtler: it facilitates both the collection of regular and predictable payments to offset unpredictable and sudden expenses and the redistribution from the better to the worse off.[^Parfit]  This latter function of insurance is common to all expenditures intended to alleviate the suffering of the worse off, who from the \"original position\" prior to birth that John Rawls asks us to consider, are the victims of bad luck in their social or genetic position.[^Rawls]"},"1053":{"comment":"Health insurance in practice varies along the three dimensions of prepayment, risk pooling, and redistribution.  Private insurance in a competitive market faces the problem that insurers with better information can draw off lower-risk individuals by charging less, leaving the non-discriminating insurer with an 'adverse selection' of high-risk patients[^Arrow].  *Private health insurance* in a market economy thus tends to reduce to an actuarially informed *health savings plan* (i.e. with no risk pooling or redistribution), similar to self-managed Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) in the US.[^GovWeb]  This voids the HSA of most insurance value, including that of prudential savings, since individuals cannot calibrate their savings rates without actuarial information."},"1054":{"comment":"On the opposite extreme, \"single-payer\" *national health insurance*, financed by general government revenues and enacted through a compulsory and universal mandate, embodies the three elements of prepayment, risk pooling, and redistribution. However, such systems are rigidly based on a nation-state concept that is only one way of achieving pooling and redistribution at scale.  For example, the Scandinavian countries admired for their socialization of risk have smaller populations than most large private health insurers in the US."},"1055":{"comment":"A natural alternative to this simplistic dichotomy of extremes precedes both in practice, namely *social health insurance* in which communities of solidarity care for those in need.  Such a pattern is familiar to nearly everyone from their family lives, and it is not hard to understand how it extended to tribes and kin relationships.  However, it also played a key role in classical Western civilization, such as the  Roman *collegia* (the members of which co-deputize each other to act in their interests), where such family relations were extended to emerging urban social formations.  Modern forms of social health insurance also emphasize the shared responsibility of a community for its members' healthcare costs and thus supplement individual, usually risk-adjusted prepayments, with collectivized contributions, usually not risk-adjusted, from the employer (formerly, from the guilds, such as the medieval German *Knappschaften*) and/or from another actor such as the state.  Most health systems in the world predominantly follow either the social or the national insurance model, although private health insurance can be found virtually everywhere.  Many current critiques of social health insurance object to i) financing healthcare from a tax on wages assessed through payroll deductions and ii) limiting entitlement to those who contribute such payments through the formal sector.  Although there is merit in these concerns, it is useful to take a ⿻ perspective on social health insurance: there is a valid sense in which individuals who share a profession, or employer, and who therefore tend to share a common set of beliefs and values, should manifest a sense of solidarity that is particularly acute.[^Durkheim]"},"1056":{"comment":"Accordingly, we can reimagine health insurance as a '⿻ good' as in [ Social Markets](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-7/eng/): one that exhibits supermodularity in group size (especially across those facing diverse risks or life situations), but not requiring or even benefiting from universal participation.  A ⿻ good builds on the strength of common belief across diverse scales and shapes embodied by ⿻ publics (see our chapter [Association and ⿻ Publics](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/)).  Of note is that the social model of health insurance began with the fact of 'association', namely, the creation of shared space for the enactment of common belief, shielded from full public surveillance and financed by ⿻ mechanisms.  This reconceptualization allows for a dramatic expansion in the scope and role of insurance: rather than simply offering savings, risk smoothing or redistribution, ⿻ insurance might be used to finance the *conditions required for* health, rather than merely the payment of services to treat disease or infirmity.  The more strongly a community interacts, the more likely it is to face common environmental or behavioral health risks, whether from the spread of communicable diseases, the ensuring of safe working conditions, the social spread of practices of healthy living or the creation of a healthy local natural environment. Health insurance might then look more like life insurance, and there is no strong reason for the two to be segmented and several strong reasons for them not to be.[^Hanson]  Essentially, such an insurance fund could act as a mutual-aid society to foster coordination in the joint production of health rather than merely in its restoration: 'healthy minds in healthy bodies' but also healthy persons in healthy families and communities (see Figure A, above).  Such a model, which we might call a \"health production society\", would ensure risk pooling and redistribution but could be much more relevant and effective at targeting the social determinants of health."},"1057":{"comment":"For example, it might be formed, in a developing country, to ensure the provision of clean water, sanitation, or adequate nutrition or in a wealthy country to mitigate the abuse of substances and ultra-processed foods that together account for 20 million global deaths a year.[^LancetCommDet]  The relevant needs are highly localized and, in fact, are often hard to address outside of a community context grounded in shared values, professional goals and belief systems.  Or another such society might be formed on the global level for infections and globally transmissible diseases such as malaria, HIV or tuberculosis, such as the [Global Fund to AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria](https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/).  National reinsurers for local health production societies could help ensure that local networks most effective at interventions do not excessively fall prey to shared health risks. In short, a range of intersecting ⿻ health production societies could move beyond an atomistic, risk-based understanding of health to address the full range of social challenges in health, recognizing the pooling of risk as simply one example of supermodularity.  Such societies would rely on the full host of technologies we have described above for building community consensus, common understanding/purpose and shielding action from outside surveillance (such as by a national insurer) that could undermine it."},"1058":{"comment":"For the purpose of this discussion, *outputs* are the direct result of health services (e.g. people vaccinated); *outcomes* are the final intended result (e.g. deaths avoided through morbidity or mortality risk reduction); and *impacts* are the knock-on effects outcomes have in the world at large (e.g. future children born).  Impact is thus an open-source commodity: it can be forked to whatever use the beneficiary can devise (Figure B).  Although impacts are a *causal* effect of health services (e.g. a child who otherwise would have died did not, and then went on to be a parent), impacts are not the primary *intended* effect of health services.  The primary intended effect of health services is reducing morbidity or mortality risk, which as we have seen is an insurance function.  Health services, which produce non-market-traded outcomes (e.g. lives saved *and* healthier lives, through the insurance function) and market-traded and non-market-traded impacts (e.g. more labour to sell *and* more time for visits with friends, through the open-source function), thus have an accounting problem: it is hard to measure the value of outcomes (e.g. the value of a life saved) but it is often still harder to measure the value of relevant impacts.  Thus, since the full social value of health projects is in practice never counted, let alone captured or rendered tradeable, many win-win health investments remain blocked."},"1059":{"comment":"**<figcaption>Figure 6-2-B.

Accordingly, if the Global Fund could have captured a fraction of the insurance value of the outcomes it produced, it would be one of the most valuable entities in the world today, and everyone would want to buy its shares.  In fact, everyone in the world already *does* own non-tradeable shares in the Global Fund, which pays out regular dividends in the form of reduced rates of disease contraction, increased economic growth and the benefits of loved ones living fuller lives among many other things.

Benefit sharing in particular has bedeviled blended-finance agreements that promised to mobilize additional sources of funds from private, profit-seeking actors; instead of mobilizing new sources of funding, however, existing arrangements have tended to allow private investors to capture the benefits of public de-risking while offering little or no financial incentive to ensure the active engagement of direct (or indirect) beneficiaries or to reward the commitment of, for example, biological, behavioural, or other services by stakeholders and participants.

In circumstances such as those in which COVID-19 emerged, one principle stands out: public health policy must be formulated in the presence of massive uncertainty about basic facts. For example, in early 2020, we knew we were confronted with two important unknowns: Q1. *How long would it take to develop an effective COVID vaccine?* and Q2. *Would populations tolerate the imposition of social distancing measures?*  Policymakers got these questions badly wrong, estimating \"at least 18 months\" for the first and \"no\" for the second when \"5 months\" and \"yes\" were closer to correct.

Taiwan followed a very different path, with rapid government support of citizen-led initiatives for, for example, tracking the supply of masks.  By moving quickly to empower citizen-led online initiatives (g0v, Polis), Taiwan was able to harvest the power of localized and contextual knowledge as a ⿻ good without imposing centralized control while respecting privacy.  Taiwan's \"extitutional\" approach was so successful that it has now been institutionalized.

Results have naturally been mixed.  Nevertheless, in a number of former colonies, notably in Canada and Australia, concerted efforts are being made on the part of colonialist successor administrations to learn from Indigeneous models of health and healthcare, to engage in the co-administration of healthcare and other health services in accordance with Indigeneous community values, and to allow for the self-determination of solutions by Indigeneous peoples.  As these experiments remain few and far between, GFMs seem a promising tool to leverage the large and diffuse bodies of textual data produced in these initiatives for the purpose of interpreting, criticizing, reimagining, and eventually redesigning, systems of healthcare administration to be more responsive to cultural value systems.  As discussed in our chapter on [Augmented Deliberation](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-4/eng/?mode=dark), \"points of view\" that are held (albeit diffusely) by organizations and even entire cultures can be represented as an \"individual\" whose \"synthetic wisdom\" can be queried in real-time interactions, or who can be tasked with designing incentive-compatible healthcare and interventions along a non-colonialist model."},"1068":{"comment":"Brain computer interfaces (BCIs, see our chapter [Post-Symbolic Communication](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-1/eng/)) are not some futuristic fantasy of science fiction but familiar objects in common use.

Eyeglasses and hearing aids are low bitrate computing devices that interface (unidirectionally, or write only) with our brains through the sensory organs; canes, crutches and wheelchairs are low bit-rate mechanical computers that interface with the brain bidirectionally (i.e. read/write), through the intermediary of both the sensory and motor organs.  Digital assistive devices, such as smartphones or portable computers, are (slightly) higher bit-rate devices that interface with the brain (read/write) through the intermediary of the sensory-motor system (usually the visual, hearing and fine-motor systems) but also through higher-order domains of functioning such as speech (e.g. voice recognition), cognition (e.g. CAPTCHAs) and memory (e.g. passwords).  These 'BCIs' interact through a range of input/output devices including keyboards, (touch)screens and a variety of other read/write interfaces.

It is natural and obvious that the trend towards further modalities of interactivity, and higher bit-rate throughput, will have in time important implications for health, especially for visual, hearing, mobility, self-care, and speech disorders, notably through Extended Reality (XR) services.  Biomedical engineering is already working to connect prosthetic devices at the cellular level (i.e. bionics)[^Frossard], and BCIs hold out the corollary promise of allowing for such connectivity at cognitive, emotional and experiential levels with, for example, powerful applications in speech and communication disorders, in the enhancement (or maintenance) of cognitive functions such as memory and, almost certainly, in novel applications for common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety, as well as for impulse control for addictive disorders."},"1070":{"comment":"Immersive shared reality (ISR)  has thus far primarily been used in non-interpersonal medical settings, such as to de-risk medical training for health workers, much as flight simulators do for pilots.

While this is sufficient to achieve expert status in diagnosing common conditions, GFMs can fine-tune on datasets orders of magnitude larger and thus outperform human readers for the diagnosis of rarely seen conditions.  Of course, human beings might specialize in such conditions and dedicate themselves to viewing a collection of many rare images, but the need for ⿻ technologies then becomes more acute: it seems impossible to imagine how large diagnostic databases of rare conditions can be compiled without established data-sharing practices across many image centres.  In this case, too, we see diffuse pockets of diversity that show 'affinity' in terms of markers that cannot be organized into low-entropy pockets based merely on traditional variables such as place, profession, or parentage; in these cases, another organizing principle must be found, and online technologies are the obvious solution.  Such technologies also need to respect privacy and confidentiality, both as a normative and legal principle. Various forms of privacy-enhancing technologies (see our chapter [Association and ⿻ Publics](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-2/eng/)) such as zero- (or low-) knowledge proofs, allow for specific kinds of information to be reliably shared without over-sharing, helping enable simultaneous respect for medical privacy and large-scale data sharing.[^medshare]"},"1072":{"comment":"In Web2 applications such as Facebook and Google, users \"willingly\" share their private information in exchange for the social benefits afforded by the platforms.

What if there was no trade-off between privacy and utility?  What if accessing medical services did not incur an open-ended contingent liability for the privacy of the individual?  Medical administrative data is 'safe' for everyone until the system is hacked because of, for example, a phishing attack: in the long run, we all face data theft with Web2 systems.  Rethinking medical practice (which requires patient data for the patient's own benefit) and medical research (which requires patient data for the benefit of others) so as to build in cryptographic principles from the foundation is an essential part of the Web3 project, with important health implications: no doubt some diseases today are still fatal only because of our failure to build such applications.  Extending the diagnostic example, medical notes of all kinds (e.g. admission, treatment, discharge) forming a part of a patient's record are a potentially vast source of information about care and outcomes that is not only highly diffuse and unstructured but also virtually unqueryable outside of a set of specific and restricted medicolegal contexts.  If there is a way to extract weak, or highly confounded, signals as the basis for novel causal insights, GFMs are perhaps the only technology that might do so.  Variations in medical practice and outcomes should in principle make it possible to identify and extract the relevant counterfactual, much as - at the population level - regression discontinuity design does.

Conversely, their next version, AlphaGo Zero, was trained solely against other model adversaries like itself, generating an unfamiliar and disconcerting yet effective “alien” strategy that surprised many master Go players. Research demonstrates that interacting with these diverse AI strategies has increased the novelty and diversity of the human Go-playing population [^4]. If such approaches were applied to the cultural sphere rather than to games, we might find novel artistic forms emerging to inspire \"awe\" or resonance in alien machine intelligences, then feeding back to provoke new artistic forms among humans, just as the \"encounter with the East\" was critical to creating modern art in the West."},"1112":{"comment":"- Digital twins and simulation for creative testing: Advanced simulations and digital twin technology will enable creative teams to test and refine their ideas in virtual replicas of real-world environments.

As we pursue increasing collaboration, we must constantly guard against:"},"1121":{"comment":"1. Loss of privacy and autonomy: In a future where every thought, idea, and creative impulse can be shared instantly, the sanctity of private thought is at risk.

By reducing the incentive for creativity, such traps risk killing the goose of creativity and diversity that lays the golden eggs of training GFMs in the first place."},"1126":{"comment":"6. Erosion of cultural diversity: In a world where creative collaborations are mediated by global platforms, there's a risk that local cultural expressions and minority voices are overshadowed by dominant narratives.

Central to this journey is the leveraging of open-source technologies and the principles of ⿻. Open-source platforms, by their very nature, encourage transparency and collective ownership, countering the risks of hidden monopolies and collusion that can arise in proprietary systems.

In this sense, the French Revolution, while polarizing and widely discussed, failed in many of its core aspirations.  By placing immediate material demands and the power to achieve them ahead of the process of building authority, the French Revolution burdened the delicate process of building social legitimacy for a new system with more weight than it could bear.  The French Revolution demanded, and got, bread; the American demanded, and got, freedom."},"1143":{"comment":"While Arendt's example is drawn from the political sphere, it resonates with literature on innovation in a wide range of fields from evolutionary biology to linguistics.

The most intimate technologies of [post-symbolic communication](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-1/eng/?mode=dark) and [immersive shared reality](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-2/eng/?mode=dark) can be powerful even in the smallest communities and relationships, creating few constraints on scale and diversification of seeding and thus making it natural to prioritize other criteria above.  At the opposite extreme, voting systems and markets are rarely used in intimate communities and require significant scale to be relevant, especially in their socially enriched forms, making entry points far scarcer, more ambitious, and potentially hazardous."},"1165":{"comment":"However, given the reasonable flexibility across scales of most ⿻ technologies, the most broadly attractive sites for experimentation will be those that both contain enough diversity *within them* to enable most applications and are themselves sufficiently diverse *across them* to allow the reasonable choice of diverse, safe, prestigious seeds.  While any simplistic quantitative representation falls short of the richness needed to characterize such examples, a simple rule of thumb is to seek roughly the same diversity *across communities* as *within communities* as quantified by the number of units as illustrated in Figure C.  In a world of (very roughly) 10 billion people, these would be units of roughly 100,000 people, as there are 100,000 such units if the whole world were partitioned into them: they have the scale of the square root of global population.  There is, of course, nothing magic about 100,000, but it offers a rough sense of the scale of communities and organizations that are the most fertile ground in which to plant the seeds of ⿻."},"1166":{"comment":"There are many kinds of communities at this scale.  Geographically, this is roughly the scale of most middle-sized municipalities (large towns or small cities).  Economically, it is the size of employees in a large corporation or, politically, in a median nation.  Religiously, it is, for example, roughly the number of Catholics in a Diocese.  Educationally, it is a bit larger than  the number of students at a large university.  Socially, it resembles the membership of many mid-sized civic organizations or social movements. Culturally, it is roughly the active fan base of a typical television program, performing artist or professional sports club.  In short, it is a prevalent level of organization in a wide range of social spheres, offering rich terrain for surveying."},"1167":{"comment":"Perhaps the two most prominent sites of experimentation with ⿻ we have highlighted above are Taiwan and web3 communities.  These two sites share some important characteristics, and yet also sharply diverge in many ways both in terms of their character and the ⿻ applications they have focused on.  Both are roughly the same size. In 2021, web3 applications (dApps) had about 1.5 million monthly active users, though only a fraction of these actively participated in the most ⿻-adjacent services, such as GitCoin.  The ⿻ services of all kinds built by the g0v community in Taiwan have reached similar numbers [^TaiwanCommunity].  The types of diversity in each community, however, are radically different."},"1168":{"comment":"While statistics are not entirely reliable, web3 users are spread quite broadly around the globe according to patterns similar to the internet.

But they are more diverse in age, technical background, political perspective and religious background.[^Web3Inclusivity]"},"1169":{"comment":"The two ecosystems have also focused on different sides of the spectrum of ⿻ we discussed in the previous part of the book.  Taiwan has focused primarily on the deeper and narrower applications of ⿻ and the fundamental protocols (identity and access) that support these most strongly.  Global web3 communities have focused on the shallower and more inclusive applications and the fundamental protocols (association, commerce and contract) that most support these."},"1170":{"comment":"Both have been critical early testbeds for ⿻, yet measuring them against our criteria also illustrates their limitations.  The Taiwan ecosystem is larger than required for many of the applications developed there, which is likely why it has hosted a range of subcommunities (that they often call \"data coalitions\") engaging in more advanced experiments supported by the broader ecosystem.  The Taiwan ecosystem has strong potential for prestige in Asia and many of the countries typically called democracies, while the geopolitical conflicts surrounding it create some challenges in making it a seed for fully equitable global spread.  Web3 communities, on the other hand, may actually be a bit small and homogeneous to allow for a fully robust test of whether new market institutions can rival the reach of capitalism.  Furthermore, many of the scandals that have plagued the web3 space endanger its ability to generally serve as a beacon of innovation that can equitably spread."},"1171":{"comment":"It is therefore crucial to carefully consider which places might be the most promising for ⿻ to spread next.  One obvious example that pervades our discussions so far is the governance of cities.  Yet precisely because we have drawn on such public sector examples so heavily thus far, we focus in this part of the book on a diversity of social sectors where ⿻ can seed reality that touches a much broader range of life than the narrow definition of public sector \"democracy\".  In doing so, we aim to match the scales mentioned above and cover a broad range of life experiences, while attending to areas with respect and prestige in a broad range of societies."},"1172":{"comment":"1. Workplace, which is a highly influential sector because so much of the capitalist economy is driven by it.  Again, especially in the largest companies, finding scale matches is quite straightforward.2.

Many health systems, as noted above, match in scale."},"1173":{"comment":"3.

Taiwan's experience shows us that more options may be available for our technological future, making it more like politics, and that one of these may involve radically enhancing how we live together and collaborate, progressing democracy much like we do technology.

We identify this descriptive element of Plurality especially with the Universal Coded Character (unicode) ⿻ which captures its emphasis on the intersectional, overlapping nature of identity for both groups and individuals.  Furthermore, in the next chapter, [Living in a ⿻ World](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/3-1/eng/?mode=dark), we highlight that this description applies not merely to human social life, but, according to modern (complexity) science, to essentially all complex phenomena in the natural world."},"1183":{"comment":"2. Normative: **Diversity is the fuel of social progress and while it may explode like any fuel (into conflict), societies succeed largely to the extent they manage to instead harness its potential energy for growth.**  We identify this concept with philosopher Danielle Allen's ideal of \"A Connected Society\" and associate it with the rainbow elements that form at the intersection of the squares in the elaborated ⿻ image on the book cover and in the figure above.  While Allen has given perhaps the clearest exposition of these ideas, as we explore in The Lost Dao they are deeply rooted in a philosophical tradition including many of the American thinkers who deeply influenced Taiwan, such as Henry George and John Dewey."},"1184":{"comment":"3. Prescriptive: **Digital technology should aspire to build the engines that harness and avoid conflagration of diversity, much as industrial technology built the engines that harnessed physical fuel and contained its explosions.** We identify this concept by the use by one of us, beginning in 2016, of the term Plurality to refer to a technological agenda. We associate it even more closely with  the use in her title (as Digital Minister) of the traditional Mandarin characters 數位 (pronounced in English as \"shuwei\") which, in Taiwan, mean simultaneously \"plural\" when applied to people and \"digital\" and thus capture the fusion of the philosophy arising in Arendt and Allen with the transformative potential of digital technology.  In the last chapter of this section, Technology for Collaborative Diversity, we argue that, while less explicit, this philosophy drove much of the development of what has come to be called the \"internet\", though because it was not sufficiently articulated it has been somewhat lost since.

A similar occupation of the American legislative Capitol almost seven years later lasted only a few hours and yet is one of the most divisive events in American history.

For the KMT (identified with the color blue), Taiwan is defined by most of its people speaking Chinese languages such as Mandarin, Taigi (Taiwanese Hokkien) and Hakka. Some would go as far as to argue that Taiwan is more ethno-historically \"Chinese\" than the PRC, with more than 80% speaking Mandarin as a primary language (compared to 70% in PRC), more than 40% following traditional religions such as Daoism (compared to less than 20% in PRC) and the official government ideology being Tridemism (more below) rather than imported Marxism.

This prominent international role was the leading irritant to the People's Republic of China (PRC) regime, preventing it from participating in international affairs and leading the CCP to change its position from initially supporting Taiwanese independence to an ideological focus on conquering Taiwan. However, as the US sought to contain its failures in Vietnam, President Richard Nixon secretly pursued accommodation with the PRC, including supporting an Albanian-sponsored Resolution 2758 by the General Assembly on October 25, 1971 that transferred recognition of \"China\" from the ROC to the PRC, finally culminating in Nixon's visit to PRC in 1972. As a result, the ROC \"withdrew\" from the UN, transforming its identity and international standing."},"1235":{"comment":"On the one hand, this withdrawal internationally greatly limited the scope of Taiwan's international activities and its ability to engage in economic and trade activities. It also led the US and much of the non-Communist world to shift from a position of unconditional alliance with the ROC to one of careful balancing of interests and ambiguity, seeking to prevent PRC's violence over Taiwan while also supporting a policy of acknowledging its \"One China\" position."},"1236":{"comment":"Internally, this change in identity undermined much of the rationale for the White Terror, as the prospect of global support for a war to suppress the \"Communist rebellion\" withered and undermined the aspirational identity of \"free China\". The contradictions between the increasingly egalitarian, Third Sector-driven and highly progressively educated population, on the one hand, and an authoritarian repressive state on the other thus became increasingly overwhelming, especially with the development of labor unions and political civic associations and the death of Chiang all before the end of the 1970s. The lives of the parents of one of the authors of this book are a perfect illustration of these trends: as pioneers of community college and consumer cooperative movements, they benefited from the cooperative support in the ROC constitution. Yet, as journalists, they covered and helped support those repressed by the state, such as in the Kaohsiung Incident of 1979 when leaders of the political opposition were imprisoned, building the foundation for democratization."},"1237":{"comment":"Taiwan's weakened international position also allowed dissidents exiled during the White Terror to put increasing pressure on Chiang's son and successor Chiang Ching-Kuo. The liberalization of Taiwan under the younger Chiang in the 1980s created an environment where democratic action, protests, essays, songs, and art reflected the growing belief for general elections.

While these \"rights\" have varied across democracies in both time and space, broad patterns are not only identifiable but have formed the foundation of documents such as the [United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) (UDHR), including equality, life, liberty, personal security, speech, thought, conscience, property, association—to name a few.

If citizens cannot form social and political associations free of duress, they cannot coordinate to contest decisions by those in power.

This famously led to the appointment of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor.[^Evans] Yet, today many democratic societies have elected leaders and governments that have curtailed liberties in a manner that converts them from democracies to what political scientists Steven Levitsky and Lucan A.

Some societies (e.g. in Europe) tend to emphasize the importance of privacy as a fundamental right necessary for civil society to exist independently of the state and thus for politics to be possible. Others (e.g. in Asia) tend to emphasize rights of assembly and association as more central to democratic function.

They corrode many of the other technologies of collaboration we describe.  While allowing the creation of some new forms, they tend to turn these into exploitative, socially irresponsible, and often reckless monopolies.

Increasing returns and public goods:  Perhaps the most restrictive condition, highlighted by the founding fathers of the \"marginal revolution\" that ushered in modern economics, is \"decreasing returns\", the opposite of the supermodularity we used to define collaboration.  This requires that production have \"decreasing marginal returns\" or more generally and less formally, that \"the whole is less than the sum of its parts\".  Only then can profitable production be consistent with the principle of, for example, paying workers their marginal contributions to production; when there are increasing returns,  paying everyone their marginal product yields a loss, as shown in Figure C.  Public goods that benefit a large number of people at little additional cost and are hard to stop people from using are an extreme case and economists have long argued that markets dramatically under-supply these.  But even less extreme cases of increasing returns/supermodularity are severely under-provided by capitalism.

Market power: In some cases where exclusion from shared goods can be imposed by barriers or violence, funding of such collaboration can be partially alleviated by charging for access.

Radio, flight, chemicals...all redesigned how we can cooperate, but also created risks and harms that previous systems of \"property rights\" and rules generally did not account for.  The victims (or in some cases beneficiaries) of these \"externalities\" are, by construction, not directly partly to market transactions.

Labor unions and cooperatives: An alternative approach to addressing market power has been the creation of corporate governance modes that try to give voice to those over whom a company holds power. Powerful unions are created to \"countervail\" the labor market power of firms and enable customer or worker representation in company governance through cooperative or \"codetermination\" structures.[^Galbraith]  While these have been some of the most vibrant and effective correctives to corporate power, they have been limited primarily to a traditional model of full-time employment that has struggled to keep pace with the dynamism and internationalism of labor markets and the diversity of collaboration in the digital age."},"1323":{"comment":"3.

Proved originally by Vickrey but first published by Richard Arnott and Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz, the Henry George Theorem states, roughly, that the taxes that can be raised from correctly designed common ownership taxes can fund all the subsidies required to fund supermodular investments.[^Arnott]  While the result is much more general, a simple illustration is the way that building better local public schools tend to raise land values: if this value can be raised by a land tax, in principle any education investment worth funding can be supported. More generally, the result suggests a near limitless potential, like that realized in a superconducting circuit, for innovation in taxation/common property and allocation of funds to super-modular activity, to generate progress."},"1345":{"comment":"2. ⿻ property: How can these funds be raised?  While partial common property schemes are an interesting start, they need to be paired with tools that can recognize and protect common interests in the way and stability with which land and other assets are used.  The voting systems we described in the previous chapter are a natural answer here and there may be great potential in ⿻ property systems that [can bring these together](https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/whats-on/beyond-cultures-of-ownership/), returning much of the value of a range of wealth to intersecting publics (\"fructus\") while also giving important access (\"usus\") and disposal (\"abusus\") rights to these communities."},"1346":{"comment":"3. ⿻ funding across boundaries: ⿻ funding can also extend dramatically beyond its current bounds, to allocate the resources thus raised.  Two of the most interesting directions are cross-jurisdictional and inter-temporal.  Current international trade treaties focus primarily on breaking down trade barriers, including the subsidies that help support supermodular production as we discussed above.  A future form of international economic cooperation could assemble matching funds for cross-jurisdictional economic ventures, harnessing a mechanism like ⿻ funding.  One key advantage of capitalism is that it is one of the few scaled systems with a significant intertemporal planning component, where companies raise funds for profits that appear distant.  One can imagine, however, even more ambitious inter-temporal economic systems with matching funds, for example, for institutions that promote cooperation across generations or with those who are not even born yet.  This might overcome concerns about the lack of long-term planning, as well as the conservation of valued past institutions, in many quarters, creating an organic version of a \"ministry for the future\".[^Robinson]"},"1347":{"comment":"4. Emergent publics: Possibilities are equally promising for how the organizations thus supported can be made truly accountable to their stakeholders.

These could then be linked to participation using voting and deliberation systems like those we highlighted earlier in ways that are much less demanding on individuals' time and attention and able to more quickly reach broadly legitimate decisions than existing collective governance.[^Optimism]  These in turn can make truly democratic and ⿻ governance of emergent publics a realistic alternative to traditional corporate governance.

Unlike the deeply personal and sensorially rich exchanges of post-symbolic communication, shared immersive reality presents a broader canvas for human interaction, enabling people to engage in shared, multisensory experiences. This chapter delves into the landscape of immersive technologies, today’s applications, tomorrow’s potential, and the frontier. It shows how immersive technologies may facilitate shared experiences that blend physical and virtual reality, complementing and expanding human experience with interactions that surpass physical, spatial, and social limitations. Immersive shared reality (ISR) creates spaces where communities may converge for socialization, gaming, entertainment, and more, facilitating connections that, while less intense than symbolic communication, are meaningful and emotionally resonant.

In fact, they have largely inspired many of the ideas about \"distributed autonomous organizations\" (DAOs) and \"smart contracts\" that are intended to escape excessive discretion, as well as leading to the high costs of the legal sector.  And yet, clearly a key reason for such complexity is the need to handle the diversity and nuance of the cases they must administer.  The leading reason, therefore, that bureaucracies become illegitimate as they try to span a broad range of social diversity is that, to accommodate this range, they have to become too complex to function properly.

The AI work that dominated the field in the 1970s and 1980s, sometimes called \"good old-fashioned AI\" (GOFAI), was in many ways an attempt to automate traditional bureaucratic processing.  Programmers, by talking to \"experts\", would attempt to encode administrative processes in complicated sets of nested rules (often called \"decision trees\"): Does the patient have a fever?  If yes, are her eyes red; if not are her lymph nodes inflamed?... This style of AI ran into major obstacles and fell from favor during the 1990s.

Rather than applying a top-down set of hard-coded rules, the system learns to classify based on examples, in a probabilistic manner and in ways that often have no simple explanation.  In neural networks, and especially GFMs, there are often billions or even trillions of \"nodes\" that receive input from each other. These nodes then triggering and inputting to other nodes, all coalescing to predict an outcome such as the next word or image.  Based on such processes, GFMs have shown remarkable and rapidly improving ability to realistically reproduce the type of flexible classification, reaction and reasoning humans are often capable of in a rapidly scalable and largely reproducible way."},"1432":{"comment":"Such successes have created the tantalizing prospect of GFMs ameliorating the fundamental tradeoff at the heart of administration.  Harnessing GFMs as components in administrative processes could allow them to take a far more diverse and unstructured range of inputs, adapt to them in the manner that a thoughtful and knowledgeable expert might, and do so in a way that offers a degree of reproducibility without imposing undue burdens on users to fill out specialized forms."},"1433":{"comment":"Explorations of this possibility have emerged especially in the last two years as interest around GFMs has exploded:"},"1434":{"comment":"- As we highlighted in our introductory vignette, these tools have shown significant promise in allowing marginalized communities access public services that they may otherwise struggle to discover and navigate.

Allen and her co-authors argue that such a system would be much more consistent with years of research in educational psychology which emphasizes the granular nature of skills and the poor fit of standard classroom practices to it and the fact that many students, especially historically marginalized and/or academically disinclined ones, often end up excluded from opportunity by such rigid structures."},"1444":{"comment":"[^NextGen]: Danielle Allen, David Kidd and Ariana Zetlin, \"A Call to More Equitable Learning: How Next-Generation Badging Improves Education for All\" Edmond and Lil Safra Center for Ethics and Democratic Knowledge Project, August 2022 at https://www.nextgenbadging.org/whitepaper."},"1445":{"comment":"Not only could GFMs and other neural networks be mirrored in the structure of such a system, they might be directly useful to it in allowing employers to cope with the more complex CVs it would create.

Furthermore,  technologies of publicity (including social networks, verifiable credentials, and distributed ledgers) would likely be critical to achieving trust, credibility and transparency around such badges.  Relatedly, but perhaps more broadly, many practices of identification and admission to credentialed spaces (clubs, schools, nations via migration etc.) could rely on a more distributed network of signals from a variety social relations as we discussed in our [Identity and Personhood](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-1/eng/?mode=dark) chapter if such a range of signals could be meaningfully processed by more adaptive administrative infrastructure in the future."},"1446":{"comment":"Even more ambitiously, it might be possible to one day integrate far more diverse legal systems into administrative practices.  The arrival of modernity and colonialism around the world largely overrode a range of traditional practices that varied dramatically by geography and culture.  Many of these practices persist informally but jar with formal legal structures imposed by often distant national governments.  These include practices around gender and sexual relationships, obligations associated with gift giving, the resolution of familial conflict and obligations, land use and more.  While in some cases there is growing consensus that the abolition of such traditions is appropriate (e.g. prohibitions on female genital marking), in many cases laws have \"overwritten\" traditional practices more out of convenience than conviction.  Traditional practices make it difficult, for example, for someone from far away to understand how to acquire land or appropriately intermarry in a community.  The sometimes enforced, sometimes cajoled homogenization of cultural practices has brought some benefits to intermixing and dynamism, but at a great cost to often ancient and diverse wisdom of cultures."},"1447":{"comment":"Just as GFMs are increasingly capable of providing low-cost translation across a growing number of languages, it is just possible to imagine that equally rapid translation across cultural norms may become feasible. These services in the past have been provided imperfectly and at great expense by cultural anthropologists and ethnographers.  Just as far cheaper and easier translation may allow a much wider range of languages to remain viable and attractive to new generations because of the external interoperability it would allow, far cheaper and easier translation of norms might make a much broader range of legal and property practices sustainable.  This would reduce the constant burden of fitting into modernity imposed not just on colonized but also on a range of \"traditional\" communities within the developed world, often in rural areas.  It would also greatly enrich the diversity that remains as the fuel for social growth and progress, as next generations of GFMs learn from being stretched by these cultural differences to perform ever more flexibly."},"1448":{"comment":"Beyond the preservation of existing diversity, such a future could help support its further diversification and speciation.  Many of the practices we have sketched in this book challenge the imaginations of even ambitious futurists.  This has led those attracted by experiments with these kinds of ideas to propose \"[network states](https://thenetworkstate.com/)\", \"[charter cities](https://chartercitiesinstitute.org/intro/)\", \"[seasteads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasteading)\" and other forms of escape from existing legal jurisdictions that, obviously, run into a range of tensions with preserving broader public goods and social order.  Yet such clean separation may not be necessary to support such experiments if they can easily be understood by and integrated into existing legal structures by machine translation.  This may empower a diverse range of experimentation with combinations of novel and traditional practices, while maintaining cooperation across broad social differences, and empowering the flourishing of ever expanding, infinite diversity in infinite combinations."},"1449":{"comment":"There may be no technology today whose pitfalls and dangers are more discussed than GFMs and for good reason.  Their opacity, mystique of autonomy (implicit in the common \"AI\" terminology that we mostly therefore avoid) that helps obscure the conditions of their creation, potential to inherit the biases of both their source data and creators, and potential for misuse all pose significant dangers."},"1450":{"comment":"In the context of administrative applications, the manifestations of these flaws are easy to see.  While GFMs may be less burdensome to interact with, they arguably further exacerbate the opacity of bureaucracy and may not much mitigate the problems of discretion and human bias given that it is often extremely challenging to map the biases of such systems or what clusters of human behaviors in the past shape their outputs today.[^Ethics]  Because such models overwhelmingly train on existing data, measuring the data diversity that AI researchers value, but struggle to define, is crucial to ensuring the models are generally performant and able to cope with diversity in the way we imagine.  The terms of power on which such diversity is explored and incorporated into the models will shape how they offer opportunity for diversity or force conformity. Many of the ethnographers of old became tools of colonial subjugation rather than voices of inclusive translation.[^colonial]  Furthermore, if abused by powerful interests, interoperability across legal regimes can easily slip into regulatory arbitrage, taking advantage of the gap between legal intent and formal rules."},"1451":{"comment":"[^Ethics]: See for example Safiya Umoja Noble, *Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism* (New York: New York University Press, 2018).

Many of the methods of collective deliberation and decision-making we highlighted in the previous chapter and further explore in the next have natural applications to defining legitimate distributions of power that can directly shape the governance of GFMs, the distribution of the economic value they create, and the ways they are collectively steered to behave in line with public wills.

Furthermore, as emphasized by Simmel and Nissenbaum, it also requires protecting this context from external surveillance: if individuals believe their communications to their association are being monitored by outsiders, they will often be unwilling to harness the context of shared community for fear their words will be misunderstood by those these communications were no intended for."},"1466":{"comment":"The internet, while enabling a far broader range of potential associations, has made the *establishment* and *protection* of context more challenging.

Clearly, a group of people who simply happen to share an interest is insufficient.  People can share an interest but have no awareness of each other, or might know each other and have no idea about their shared interest.  As social scientists and game theorists have recently emphasized, the collective action implied by \"organization\" requires a stronger notion of what it is to have an \"interest\", \"belief\" or \"goal\" in common. In the technical terms of these fields, the required state is what they call (approximate) \"[common knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic))\"."},"1469":{"comment":"To motivate what this means to a game theorist, it may be helpful to consider why simply sharing a belief is insufficient to allow effective common action.

Galbraith to coin the idea of \"the conventional wisdom\".[^Affluent] Furthermore, we can use this notion of community to refer not just to beliefs about facts, but also moral or intentional beliefs.  We can think of a \"common belief\" (in the moral sense) of a community as being things that everyone believes everyone else holds as a moral principle and believes everyone else believes that everyone holds, etc.  Similarly, a \"common goal\" can be something everyone believes others intend and believes everyone believes everyone intends and so on.  Such \"common beliefs\" and \"common intentions\" are important to what is often called \"[legitimacy](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html)\", the commonly understood notion of what is appropriate.[^Legitimacy]"},"1479":{"comment":"In game theory, it is common to model individuals as collections of intentions/preferences and beliefs.  This notion of community gives a way to think about groups similarly and distinctly from the individuals that make them up, given that common beliefs and intentions need not be the same as those of the individuals that are part of that group (on average): group beliefs and goals are common beliefs and goals of that group.  In this sense, the freedom to create associations can be understood as the freedom to create common beliefs and goals.  Yet creating associations is not enough.  Just as we argued in the previous chapter that protecting secrets is critical to maintaining individual identity, so too associations must be able to protect themselves from surveillance, as should their common beliefs become simply the beliefs of everyone, they cease to be a separate association just as much as an individual who spills all her secrets ceases to have an identity to protect.  As such, privacy from external surveillance or internal over-sharing is just as critical as is establishing associations to their freedom."},"1480":{"comment":"It is little surprise, then, that many of the historical technologies and spaces that come to mind when we think of the freedom of association are precisely geared toward achieving common beliefs and shielding common beliefs from external beliefs from outsiders. Searching, in the imagery online or the writings of political philosophers, for \"freedom of association\" typically yields images of protests in public spaces, meetings in public spaces like parks and squares and group discussions in private clubs.[^PrivateClubs]  As illustrated above, group meetings and statements made openly in front of group members are crucial to achieving common beliefs and understanding among that group.  Private pamphlets may achieve individual persuasion, but given the lack of common observation, game theorists have argued that they struggle to create public beliefs in the same way a shared declaration, like the child's public laughter, can."},"1481":{"comment":"But purely public spaces have important limitations: they do not allow groups to form their views and coordinate their actions outside the broader public eye.  This may undermine their cohesion, their ability to present a united face externally, and their ability to communicate effectively harnessing an internal context.  This is why associations so often have enclosed gathering places open only to members: to allow the secrecy that Simmel emphasized as critical to group efficacy and cohesion.[^SimSec] The crucial question we thus face is how systems of network communication can offer the brave new world of \"communities of interest\" these same or even more effective affordances to create protected common beliefs."},"1482":{"comment":"To the extent parks and squares are the site of protest and collective action, we might well search for a digital public square, a function many [platforms](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-twitter-town-square/) have purported to serve.[^PariserMusk]  Sites on the original World Wide Web offered unprecedented opportunities for a range of people to make their messages available.

It also allows the key controller to sign messages so that others can verify the authenticity of the message.

Thus, the right to freedom of association and the right to the integrity of personhood are inseparable: if it is our entanglement in a diversity of social groups that creates our separateness as a person, it is only by protecting the integrity of that diversity that separate personhood is possible.

Comparative advantage is understood as an 'economic law' stating in effect that there are guaranteed gains from diversity that can be realized through the market mechanism.  This idea has been extremely influential in neoliberal economics (see [Social Markets](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-7/eng/?mode=dark)), although later iterations are more sophisticated than the Ricardian version and one need not accept the simplistic \"free trade\" implications to appreciate the benefits of gains from trade.  Furthermore, given our emphasis on diversity, what we mean by \"gains\"  here is context specific and need not be simplistically economic; instead, it will be defined by the norms and values of the individuals and communities coming together.  Furthermore, our focus is less on people or groups *per se* than on the fabric running through and separating them, social difference.

A simple way to understand this is by analogy to energy systems. Prior to industrialism, rare encounters with powerful thermodynamic effects (such as oil fires in the ground) were met with fear and attempts to suppress these conflagrations.  Yet with the advent of industrial harnessing of fossil fuels, it became more common to greet such explosions with a prospector's eye, looking to harness the potential energy that led to these explosions productively. In a world beset by conflict, we must learn to build engines that, just as in the Taiwanese example we opened with, convert the potential energy driving these conflicts into useful work.  The ⿻ age must learn to harness social and informational potential energy as the industrial age did for fossil fuels and the nuclear age did for atomic energy.[^thermo]  Such an age may fulfill the prophecy of Matthew 20:16, \"[So the last shall be first, and the first last](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2020%3A16&version=KJV)\", as the most diverse and conflict-plagued places on earth (especially in Africa) hold arguably more potential energy than anywhere on the planet."},"1539":{"comment":"[^thermo]: The analogy here is even tighter than it might seem at first.  What is usually called \"energy\" is actually \"low entropy\"; a uniformly hot system has lots of \"energy\" but this is not actually useful.   All systems for producing \"energy\" work by harnessing this low entropy (\"diversity\") to produce work; such systems also have the advantage of avoiding \"uncontrolled\" releases of heat through explosions (\"conflict\").  There is thus a quite literal and direct analogy between ⿻'s goal of harnessing social low entropy and industrialism's goal of harnessing physical low entropy."},"1540":{"comment":"While novel in a certain sense, this is also one of the oldest and most universally resonant of all human ideas.

Languages are the simplest example, but all kinds of actions and behaviors carry differing meaning depending on cultural contexts.[^Wedeen]"},"1556":{"comment":"[^Wedeen]: Lisa Wedeen, \"Conceptualizing Culture: Possibilities for Political Science\", *American Political Science Review* 96, no. 4 (2002): 713--728."},"1557":{"comment":"Solidarity and culture are so challenging because they stand in the way not of specific agreements about information or goals but of communication, mutual comprehension, and the ability to regard someone else as a partner capable and worthy of such exchange. While they are in an abstract sense related to beliefs and values, solidarities and culture in practice precede these in human development: we are aware of our family and those who will protect us and learn to communicate long before we consciously hold any views or aim for any goals.  Being so foundational, they are the hardest to safely adjust or change, usually requiring shared life-shaping experiences or powerful intimacy to reform."},"1558":{"comment":"Beyond the difficulty of overcoming difference, it also holds an important peril. Bridging differences for collaboration often erodes them, harnessing their potential but also reducing that potential in the future.  While this may be desirable for protection against conflict, it is an important cost to the productive capacity of diversity in the future.  The classic illustration is the way that globalization has both brought gains from trade, such as diversifying cuisine, while at the same time arguably homogenizing culture and thus possibly reducing the opportunity for such gains in the future.  A critical concern  in ⿻ is not just harnessing collaboration across diversity but also *regenerating* diversity, ensuring that in the process of harnessing diversity it is also replenished by the creation of new forms of social difference. Again, this is analogous to energy systems which must ensure that they not only harvest but also regenerate the sources of their energy to achieve sustainable growth."},"1559":{"comment":"Because of the tensions between collaboration and diversity, one would naturally expect a range of approaches that make different trade-offs in terms of *depth* and *breadth*.  Some aim to allow deep, rich collaboration at the cost of limiting this collaboration to small and/or homogeneous groups. We can think of the \"depth\" of collaboration roughly in terms of the *degree* of supermodularity for a fixed set of participants: how much greater is what they create than the sum of what they can create separately, according to the standards of participants.  Relationships of love or other deep connection are among the deepest as they allow transformations that are foundational to life, meaning and reproduction that those participating could never have known separately. Superficial, transactional, and often anonymous transactions, as permeate market-based capitalism, on the other hand, brings small gains from trade but nowhere near the depth of connection of intimate love."},"1560":{"comment":"One rough way to think about quantifying the differences between these interaction modes is in terms of the information theoretical concept of *bandwidth*.  Capitalism tends to reduce everything to a single number (scalar) of money.  Intimacy, on the other hand, typically not only immerses all senses but goes beyond this to touch \"[proprioception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception)\" (also known as kinesthesia), the internal sensations of one's own body and being that neuroscientists believe constitute a majority of all sensory input.[^proprio]  Intermediate modalities lie between, activating structured forms of symbols or limited sets of sense."},"1561":{"comment":"[^proprio]: Uwe Proske and Simon C.

Thinner and shallower collaboration scales more easily.  While the simplest notion of scale is the number of people involved, this is shorthand.  Breadth is best understood in terms of inclusion across lines of social and cultural distance rather than simply large numbers of people.  For example, deep collaboration may well be easier among a large extended family, physically co-located and sharing a language and religion than among a handful of people scattered around the world, speaking different languages, etc."},"1563":{"comment":"**<figcaption>Figure 5-0-A. The trade-off between breadth of diversity and depth of collaboration represented as points along a production possibilities frontier</figcaption>**</figure>"},"1564":{"comment":"We can see there being a full spectrum of depth and breadth, representing the trade-off between the two. Economists often describe technologies by \"production possibilities frontiers\" (PPF) illustrating the currently possible trade-offs between two desirable things that are in tension.  In Figure A, we plot this spectrum of cooperation as such a PPF, grouping different specific modalities that we study below into broad categories of \"communities\" with rich but narrow communication, \"states\" with intermediate on both and \"commodities\" with thin but broad cooperative modes. The goal of ⿻ is to push this frontier outward at every point along it, as we have illustrated in these seven points, each becoming a technologically enhanced extension.[^KojinKaratani]"},"1565":{"comment":"[^KojinKaratani]: This tripartite division of modes of exchange into communities, state, and commodities is inspired by Kojin Karatani, *The Structure of World History: From Modes of Production to Modes of Exchange* (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2014). Karatani's aspiration to achieve the return of community at a broader scale can be seen as an ambitious example of ⿻."},"1566":{"comment":"One example illustrating this trade-off is common in political science: the debate over the value of deliberation compared to voting in democratic polities.  High quality deliberation is traditionally thought to only be feasible in small groups and thus require processes of selection of a small group to represent a larger population such as representative government elections or sortition (choosing participants at random), but is believed to lead to richer collaboration, more complete airing of participant perspectives and therefore better eventual collective choices.  On the other hand, voting can involve much larger and more diverse populations at much lower cost but comes at the cost of each participant providing thin signals of their perspectives in the form (usually) of assent for one among a predetermined list of options."},"1567":{"comment":"But for all the debate between the proponents of \"deliberative\" and \"electoral\" democracy, it is important to note that these are just two points along a spectrum (both mostly within the \"state\" category) and far from even representing the endpoints of that spectrum.  As rich as in-person deliberations can be, they provide nowhere near the depth of sharing, connection and building of common purpose and identity that the building of committed teams (as in e.g. the military) and long-term intimate relationships do.  And while voting can allow hundreds of millions to have a say on a decision, it has never cut across social boundaries in any way close to what impersonal, globalized markets do everyday.  All these forms have trade-offs and the very diversity of the ways in which we have historically navigated them and the ways in which these have improved overtime (e.g. the advent of video conferencing)  should be a source of hope that concerted development can radically improve these trade-offs, allowing richer collaboration across a broader diversity of social differences than in the past."},"1568":{"comment":"Yet aiming at \"improving\" this trade-off requires us to specify at least something about what would count as an improvement.   What makes a collaboration good or meaningful?  What precisely constitutes social difference and diversity?  How can we measure both?"},"1569":{"comment":"One standard perspective, especially in economics and quantitatively inclined fields is to insist that we should specify a global \"objective\" or \"social welfare\" function against which progress should be judged.  The difficulty, of course, is that, in the face of the limitless possibilities of social life, any attempt to specify such a criterion is destined to crash land on the shores of the unknown and possibly unknowable. The more ambitiously we apply such a criterion in pursuing ⿻, the less robust it will prove, because the more deeply we connect to others across greater difference, the more likely we are to realize the failings of our initial vision of the good.  Insisting on specifying such a criterion in advance of learning about the shape of the world leads to premature optimization, which prominent British computer scientist Tony Hoare once labeled \"[the root of all evil](https://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=1513451)\".[^Hoare]"},"1570":{"comment":"[^Hoare]: Randall Hyde, \"The Fallacy of Premature Optimization\" *Ubiquity* February, 2009 available at https://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=1513451."},"1571":{"comment":"One of the worst such evils is papering over the richness and diversity of the world.  Perhaps the archetypal example is conclusions about the optimality of markets in neoclassical economics, which depend on extremely simplistic assumptions and have often been used to short-circuit attempts to discover systems for social resource management that deal with problems of increasing returns, sociality, incomplete information, limited rationality, etc.  As will become evident in the coming chapters, we know very little about how to even build social systems that are sensitive to these features, much less even approximately optimal in the face of them.  This shows why the desire to optimize, chasing some simple notion of the good, often seduces us away from the aspirations of ⿻ as much as it aids us in pursuing it.  We can be tempted to maximize what is simple to describe and easy to achieve, rather than anything we are really after."},"1572":{"comment":"Optimization, especially in the pursuit of a \"social welfare function\" carries another pitfall: of \"playing God\" or idolatry.  Maximizing social welfare requires taking a \"view from nowhere\" and imagining one can influence conditions on a universal level available to no one.  We all act from and for specific people and communities, with goals and possibilities limited by who we are, where we sit and who cares what we say, in a network of other forces that hopefully together form a pattern that can avoid disaster.  Tools that are only good for some abstractly universal perspectives do not just overreach: they will appeal to no one who can actually adopt them."},"1573":{"comment":"At the same time, there is an opposite extreme danger.  If we simply pursue designs that imitate features of life and thus engage our attention with little sense of purpose or meaning, we can easily be co-opted to serve the darkest of human motives.  The profit motives and power games that organize so much of today's world do not naturally serve any reasonable definition of a common good. The dystopian novels of Neal Stephenson, the [*Black Mirror*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror) series and the predicament of technologist Tunde Martins in the recent Nigerian science fiction show [Iwájú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iw%C3%A1j%C3%BA) remind us of how technical advance decoupled from human values can become traps that fray social bonds and allow the power-hungry to loot, control and enslave us."},"1574":{"comment":"Nor do we look to hypothetical scenarios to perceive the danger of compelling technologies pursued without a broader guiding mission.  The dominant online platforms of the \"Web2\" era such as Google, Facebook and Amazon grew precisely out of a mentality of bringing critical features of real-world sociality (viz. collectively determined emergent authority, social networks and commerce) to the digital world.  While these services have brought many important benefits to billions of people around the world, we have extensively reviewed above, their many shortcomings and the dangerous path they have brought the world without a broader set of public goals to guide them.  We must build tools that serve the felt needs of real, diverse populations, meeting them where they are, and yet we cannot ignore the broader social contexts in which they sit and the conflicts that we might exacerbate in meeting those perceived needs."},"1575":{"comment":"Luckily, a middle, pragmatic, ⿻ path is possible.  We need neither take a God's eye nor a ground-level view exclusively.  Instead, we can build tools that pursue the goals of a range of social groups, from intimate families and friends to large nations, always with an eye to limitations of each perspective and on the parallel developments we must connect to and learn from emanating from other parallel directions of development.  We can aim to reform market function by focusing on social welfare, but always doing so based on adding to our models' key features of social richness revealed by those pursuing more granular perspectives and expecting our solutions will at least partly founder on their failures to account for these.  We can build rich ways for people to empathize with others' internal experience, but with an understanding that such tools may well be abused if not paired with the discipline of deliberation, regulation and well-structured markets."},"1576":{"comment":"We can do this guided by a common principle of cooperation across difference that is too broad to be formulated as a consistent objective function, yet elegant enough to unify a wide range of technologies: **we develop tools that allow greater cooperation and consensus at the same time as they make space for greater diversity**.  Consider two extremely different examples we will discuss below that both can be justified by this logic: [brain-to-brain interfaces](https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/bci/projects/brain-to-brain-interfaces/) and [approval voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting).  While the first is a wildly futuristic and disturbingly invasive concept, the second is an old and widely applied voting method.  Yet the simple idea of cooperation across difference helps justify both: a key aspiration of brain-to-brain interface is to allow children to retain more of their imagination as they grow to adulthood by allowing them to directly share this imagination rather than having to fit it into what they can write or draw.[^B2B]  This allows much greater diversity and much greater common understanding.  Similarly, a key goal of approval voting (where citizens can vote for as many candidates as they wish and the one with the most votes wins) is to simultaneously ensure that the elected candidate has very wide general consensus *and* enable there to exist a much broader diversity of candidates because voters are not afraid a \"third party\" will act as a spoiler as voters can choose both the third party and one of the leading ones.[^Approval]"},"1578":{"comment":"Each of these technologies carries its risks: brain-to-brain interfaces could easily be used to manipulate, and approval voting could create a race towards mediocrity, as we discuss in relevant chapters below.  Yet the diversity of modes highlighted by this approach gives hope that any connections we make and conflicts we resolve are but one stage in a process of collaboration across diversity.  Every successful step forward should bring even more challenging forms of diversity into the world we can perceive, reshaping our understanding of ourselves and our aspirations and demanding that we struggle that much harder to bridge them.  While such an aspiration lacks the satisfying simplicity of maximizing an objective function or pursuing technical advance and social richness wherever they lead, this is precisely why it is the hard path worth pursuing.

High-bandwidth communication could lead to a homogenization of thoughts and experiences as individual perspectives merge into collective consciousness, erasing our differences."},"1618":{"comment":"Balancing telepathic communication with lower-bandwidth, structured forms of communication is essential to preserve privacy, autonomy, diversity, and human governance in the future. Communication, like speech and text, is less direct and immediate than telepathy but is structured and deliberate. It requires the sender to formulate thoughts into words or sentences, providing a level of control and reflection that instantaneous telepathic communication lacks. Markets and voting systems also serve as quintessential examples of lower-bandwidth, structured forms of communication, offering a counterbalance. In markets, the myriad decisions made by consumers and producers are communicated through the price mechanism. This system, while less immediate and detailed than telepathic communication, provides a structured and aggregated way of expressing preferences and values. It allows for privacy in decision-making, as individuals do not have to reveal the full spectrum of their thoughts and motivations. Similarly, voting is a deliberate, structured form of communication where individuals express their political and social preferences at a fixed point in time. Unlike continuous and invasive telepathic streams, voting encapsulates the will of the populace in a manner that is both manageable and interpretable, preserving the autonomy of the individual voter. This structured approach is crucial in maintaining a balance between efficient communication and the safeguarding of personal autonomy, privacy, and democratic processes, thereby acting as a vital check against the overreach of an all-encompassing telepathic matrix."},"1619":{"comment":"[^vanLeeuwen]: P. van Leeuwen, D.

While there has been a substantial return to physical work since the end of the pandemic, at least a part of the change appears here to stay; Barreto et al. find that after the pandemic, workers on average want to work about half the week from home and believe their productivity is similar or better in that setting.

These range from casual lunches to various kinds of extreme team sports, such as \"trust falls\"[^TrustFall], simulated military exercises, ropes courses, etc.  What nearly all these have in common is that they create a shared activity that benefits from and thus helps develop trust among members, in a similar manner to the way we discussed shared military service developing strong and lasting cooperative bonds in the [Post-Symbolic Communication](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-1/eng/?mode=dark) chapter."},"1631":{"comment":"Obviously most such activities currently rely heavily on being in person, thus many hybrid and fully remote teams, especially those that have many members who started as remote employees, miss the team-building benefits created by such activities or can achieve them only at considerable travel expense.  ISR offers significant potential for overcoming this challenge.  Lunches among sufficiently realistic avatars, ones reflecting detailed facial expressions for example, may soon help bring the rich connections achieved in the office within the reach of remote teams.  While it would seem impossible to achieve the vivid connections of parties or extreme sports in remote shared reality, there is increasingly strong evidence that real experiences of fear and trust can develop in sufficiently realistic simulated environments.[^fear]  As \"e-sports\" begin to rival the popularity and, in the right ISR environments, physical intensity of in-person physical sports, the benefits of \"campus athletics\" may increasingly make their way to remote work."},"1632":{"comment":"[^fear]: Jih-Hsuan Tammy Lin, \"Fear in Virtual Reality (VR): Fear Elements, Coping Reactions, Immediate and Next-Day Fright Responses Toward a Survival Horror Zombie Virtual Reality Game\", *Computers in Human Behavior* 72 (2017): 350-361."},"1633":{"comment":"Yet even more promising how recreation-at-a-distance can mimic approaches of in-person teams is the harnessing of digital tools to create even deeper connections than are possible without digital aids.  The simplest examples would be extensions to extreme sports or military scenarios that would be unsafe or unreasonably costly to simulate in person.

While many of the functions these campuses bring together are fairly separate or organizationally distant, broad co-location is often a goal because of the chance intersections it is thought to allow that may stimulate work across divisions of the company.  Such \"agglomeration\" effects have been shown by a large economic literature to be an important source of the economic benefit of cities.[^agglom]  A core role of corporate campuses is to capture these benefits within a company."},"1636":{"comment":"Achieving this goal, however, requires careful design.  Excessive segregation by organization and discipline or focus on core work undermines the benefit of agglomerative spontaneity.  Excessive fragmentation by organization and discipline undermines direct productivity.  Different elements of campus (walkways, dining facilities, offices, shared space, recreational facilities etc.) play diverse roles in fostering direct work and spontaneous connections.  For instance, Steve Jobs redesigned [Pixar](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2018/11/16/pixar-s-critically-acclaimed-emeryville-campus.html)'s headquarters to include a central atrium with a large theater, cafeteria, mailboxes, and viewing rooms.[^PixarsHead] By encouraging computer scientists, animators and other staff to mingle in a shared space, this layout boosts chance encounters and cross-pollination.  Yet architectural revamps pose significant challenges: they're costly and need to support other elements that are specific to each company, such as nature of the work or brand identity.

These configurations can be prototyped far more rapidly and flexibly than building a physical campus, allowing for a range of exploration in the course of time employees spend attending virtual meetings.  Based on feedback, employees can even help redesign the space and iterate on the layout.  If a potential design seems to be achieving its goals reasonably well and fits a potential site, it could then be \"printed\" through a more standard engineering and construction process.

Business leaders frequently misunderstand the needs of their customers, the challenges within their teams and the duplication of work because meeting with the relevant stakeholders would take too long. To make matters worse, many meetings are quite ineffective, as dominant personalities carry on and the wisdom of those who are less empowered or assertive is lost. In the realm of white-collar work, meetings are a notorious time sink, with office employees dedicating about 18 hours a week on average. This not only represents approximately $25,000 in annual payroll costs per employee but also encompasses meetings that 30% of employees find unnecessary. Moreover, a reduction in meetings by 40% has been linked to a 71% surge in productivity, underlining the critical need for streamlining communication.[^meeting-stats2] Anything that could significantly speed meetings and increase their quality could transform organizational productivity.[^Meetings]"},"1640":{"comment":"[^Meetingstat]: Branka, \"Meeting Statistics – 2024\", *Truelist Blog* February 17, 2024 at https://truelist.co/blog/meeting-statistics/."},"1641":{"comment":"While meetings have a variety of goals and structures, perhaps the most common type is an attempt to share a variety of perspectives on a common project to achieve alignment and assignment of responsibilities.  Such meetings are closely connected to the deliberative conversations we highlighted in our chapter on [Augmented Deliberation](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/5-4/eng/?mode=dark).  An important reason why, despite the rise of asynchronous communication via services like [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) and [Trello](https://trello.com/), synchronous meetings remain so prevalent is that asynchronous dialogs often suffer from the same lack of thoughtful time and attention management that are necessary to make synchronous meetings successful.

Today, the responsibility for setting direction is typically limited to the top of the pyramid.

And even if executives were all exceptional visionaries, their combined intellect is unlikely to suffice for the task at hand.

The rigidity created by this hiring process is a leading reason so many are forced into the narrow paths of learning we highlighted in the previous chapter."},"1646":{"comment":"The capabilities of social identity systems, modern large language models (LLMs) and remote shared reality technologies may help in addressing many of these challenges. Network-based verification systems, as we described in the [Identity and Personhood](https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/4-1/eng/?mode=dark) chapter can allow the secure verification of a diversity of credentials and accomplishments across a large gulf of social distance rapidly and cheaply.  LLMs, properly trained and fine-tuned, should soon allow the \"translation\" of resumés not just across languages, but across diverse social contexts, helping hiring managers understand \"equivalent\" qualifications across a range of settings and a diversity of paths that could support performance in a role. They can similarly help applicants better understand the range of roles their background may qualify them for."},"1647":{"comment":"They also may be able to provide a richer sense of the range of diversity spanned by a company's customer base that would be helpful to represent among employees and help them to empathize and connect with customers.

Remote shared reality experiences can help them hold interactive recruiting events in a wider range of venues at lower cost and allow applicants a deeper sense of the work environment.  They can also accelerate the acculturation and onboarding processes much as we described in the previous chapter. In short, these tools can together allow for a future of human resources that reaches a far wider range of talent and allows opportunities for everyone to shine as the unique intersectional contributors they are."},"1648":{"comment":"In most organizations, power—whether it's about controlling resources, making decisions, accessing important information, or having the power to reward or discipline others—is tied to one's position. Formal hierarchy provides clarity in terms of who is responsible for what, but this \"legibility\" has significant drawbacks.  Positional authority can be too expansive, like a finance executive becoming CEO and suddenly claiming expertise in product design. It is also binary (you either have it or you do not), which means that incompetent managers retain power until they’re removed (often much later than ideal).

Power can shift fluidly based on contribution. Emerging technologies can help match value added with decision rights. For example, natural language processing can sift through communication data to spot associates who consistently provide valuable insights on specific topics. Generative foundation models (GFMs) can create dynamic social graphs that pinpoint key network figures and provide rich context on the nature of their connections and compile feedback from various sources to present a comprehensive assessment of an individual's \"natural leadership.\" These approaches recognize and reward valuable contributions of people irrespective of role, and serve as a reality check for those who still occupy formal positions of authority.  Over time, they can reduce dependency on formal hierarchies altogether."},"1650":{"comment":"Another effect of traditional hierarchies is that those managed by different high-level managers come to form different organizations within the parent, each with their own cultures, goals and visions.  While these internal distinctions are usually viewed as important to ensuring accountability, they are also often viewed as a barrier to organizational cooperation and dynamism, potentially undermining the collaborations needed to provide common infrastructure and meet the needs (\"disruptions\") of changing political, economic, social and technological environments.  For example, the organization in which one of us works, Microsoft, has sometimes been satirized for its internal organization conflicts and, under the leadership of its current CEO Satya Nadella has worked to forge a \"[One Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com/v2/global/en/culture)\" culture to overcome this.[^Refresh]"},"1651":{"comment":"[^Refresh]: Satya Nadella with Greg Shaw and Jill Tracie Nichols, *Hit Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft's Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone* (New York: Harper Business, 2017)."},"1652":{"comment":"While much of this has been demonstrated through exemplars of such cooperation and inspirational leadership, Nadella has also helped establish some institutions intended to help achieve the organizational equivalent of the \"solidarity and dynamism\" we have discussed above.  In particular, one of us had the honor to serve in the Office of Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) [Kevin Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Scott_(computer_scientist)), whose duties included coordinating cross-company investments that no one organization would find it in their interest to take on and stimulating \"intrapreneurship\", the building of new business lines often drawing on expertise across existing organizations.[^PEST]"},"1653":{"comment":"[^PEST]: An entertaining outgrowth of corporate acronyms in this case was that he had the title OCTOPEST (Office of the Chief Technology Officer Political Economist and Social Technologist), paralleling the title of his colleague Jaron Lanier who at the time of this writing remains Microsoft's [OCTOPUS](https://www.jaronlanier.com/general.html) (Office of the Chief Technology Officer Prime Unifying Scientist)."},"1654":{"comment":"While OCTO achieved much (including incubating the now well-known relationship with OpenAI) during the author's time there, a persistent challenge was harnessing a small staff that was necessarily much less informed than those \"on the ground\" about business needs and opportunities to decide on major investments and incubations intended to bring cross-cutting benefits.  A leading example was the cross-company technical project he was most involved with, around Web3 strategy, where interested and expert employees were widely scattered across the company.  This was particularly difficult because the intention was for many of these investments to accrue not directly to the bottom line of an internal start-up, but to other business lines. Because of this and the structure of jobs at Microsoft, the typical use of large incentives for eventual success to compensate for the likelihood of failure are hard to apply.  Various organizations navigate this challenge in different ways; for example, Google (now Alphabet) has traditionally given employees [20% of their time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_project_time) free to pursue passion projects for the organization, outside their primary organizational role.[^Google20]  Yet this suffers the obvious challenge that individuals may pursue idiosyncratic projects that at worst may not be aligned to the broader mission and at best usually fail to scale as they do not bring enough people together to cooperate on an ambitious project."},"1655":{"comment":"[^Google20]: Annika Steiber and Sverker Alänge, \"A Corporate System for Continuous Innovation: the Case of Google Inc.\", *European Journal of Innovation Management* 16, no. 2: 243-264."},"1656":{"comment":"A natural alternative to the extremes of centralized management and uncoordinated individual initiative would be to harness ⿻ conversational and funding tools. An organization like OCTO could have a much larger budget, but much less discretion, providing matchmaking and cross-pollination services and matching funds for investments with support from many organizations.  It could use data from or posting within internal communication platforms to identify cross-organizational clusters of interests, host free and fun events to build connections across these organizations, and then offer matching funds if a diversity of organizations are willing to invest employee time or other resources in supporting a shared investment or incubation.  Compared to the \"20% time model\", this would offer much more \"free time\" to pursue projects that have genuine cross-organizational support, but that one's direct reporting chain sees as tangential, and less support for purely idiosyncratic interests.  As such, it would empower employees to coordinate investments among themselves that could transform the business overall, allowing agility to avoid disruption."},"1657":{"comment":"Putting these together, we can imagine a future where remote teams can form the same strong bonds as in-person teams, where in-person teams can co-design inclusive workplaces that foster spontaneous connections while maintaining focus, where meetings are far more efficient and inclusive even when asynchronous, where a far wider range of talent can be placed into leading roles. This could create a more inclusive and representative workplace where employees can easily collaborate across divisions and with corporate support to overcome hurdles and build the common infrastructure and new ventures their employer needs to survive and thrive in a dynamic business environment.

If agglomeration benefits are about 12% for work facilities and this applies again to half of formal sector work and can be improved by 50%, again we get 2% of GDP.  If meetings are 25% of formal sector work time and can be improved by 25%, this is about 4% of GDP. Standard economic estimates of the costs of labor search and matching are about 4% of GPD, similar to the cost spent on human resources; if mitigated by 50% this would raise GDP by 2% (not to mention significantly dampen the cost of business cycle unemployment).
